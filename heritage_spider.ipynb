            "text Most Americans view nuclear weapons as a relic of the Cold War. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed in 1985 “that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.” That thinking has remained a “given” for the last 37 years. Unfortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin may have other ideas.Just five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin personally oversaw nuclear exercises and issued subtle nuclear threats against the West should Ukraine become a part of NATO. Once his war begun, the threats became less subtle. More recently, Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert. While the Pentagon reports it has not detected significant changes in Russia’s nuclear posture, Putin’s nuclear muscle flexing has prompted concern over how far he will go.A Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine—or worse, against a NATO state—is unlikely. Doing so would break a 75-year nuclear taboo while completely alienating the rest of the world from Russia. But the chances are not zero, either. The U.S. must take the threat seriously.>>> Russia Links Ukraine Sanctions to Iran Nuclear Talks to Shake Down Biden AdministrationWhen it comes to nuclear long-range missiles—those able to reach each other’s homelands—the U.S. and Russia have rough parity stemming from the New START arms control treaty. But Russia also has more than 2,000 low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons that are meant for use on a battlefield. In this category, Russia’s weapons outnumber the U.S. at least 10 to 1.The prevailing American view is that nuclear weapons should be used only for deterrence. But Russia’s official warfighting doctrine specifically reserves the right to use tactical nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict to compel the enemy to back down.Here’s where the nuclear danger comes in. If Russia continues to fail in its conventional military efforts to seize Ukrainian cities and topple the Ukrainian government, Putin might be tempted to fire a tactical nuclear weapon to compel Ukrainians to surrender and signal to the West that he will not take failure as an option.A nuclear attack on Ukraine, even with a very small nuclear weapon, would cause severe destruction and take thousands of lives if launched at a populated area. While NATO would not be obliged to respond militarily, such an attack would likely lead to further Russian isolation from the world and unite countries against Putin.A nuclear attack on a NATO state is less likely. Putin knows any nuclear attack will be met with a nuclear response. But short of launching a nuclear weapon at a NATO state, Putin may issue further nuclear threats against NATO intervention in Ukraine.Indeed, Putin’s order to move Russia’s nuclear weapons on higher alert was likely meant to scare away the West from getting involved. Or, if Ukraine continues to repel Russian forces, Putin may threaten nuclear attack to compel the West to stop sending military equipment to Ukraine.>>>What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWar against a major nuclear power—especially one that views nuclear weapons as “useable”—introduces complexities into the fight and forces the United States and its allies to proceed with caution. But by the same measure, NATO is a nuclear alliance, too. To deter nuclear war with Russia, NATO must be sure to communicate its resolve to use nuclear weapons if attacked.Moving forward, the United States must ensure that a strong nuclear deterrence is at the top of its agenda. After the Cold War, the United States retired thousands of nuclear weapons while letting its existing forces become older and older. Now, the U.S. is scrambling to replace its nuclear forces with modern systems before they age into obsolescence.Putin’s recent inflammatory rhetoric, nuclear saber-rattling and military actions in Ukraine are proof of the need for a strong, modern U.S. nuclear force. Indeed, the nuclear dangers in Ukraine have taught us that nuclear war is a 21st century concern. As much as U.S. policymakers might like to wish away nuclear weapons from existence, unfortunately, the enemy gets a vote.This piece originally appeared in MSN.com \n",

            "text In the latest in a series of specious and outlandish justifications for its illegal, immoral, and brutal invasion of sovereign Ukraine, Russia is claiming that Washington and Kyiv are working together to develop chemical and biological weapons.Pure Putin propaganda.Indeed, according to the U.S. State Department this week:The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.On the other hand, the State Department notes:It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.No surprises in that State Department claim, considering that Russian operatives have used the Novichok nerve agent to attack former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and Russian political dissident Alexei Navalny in recent years.Russia has also shamelessly supported the regime of Syria’s Bashar Assad, which has used a variety of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in the brutal civil war there. With the war in Ukraine in a stalemate that includes significant losses for the Russian forces in the face of stiff Ukrainian political and military resistance, Russia is looking for ways to reenergize its political and military campaign to subjugate Ukraine.To do this, Moscow might develop a “false flag” operation, involving the use of chemical (or less likely biological) weapons in Ukraine against Russian forces, ethnic Russians in Ukraine, or even Ukrainian civilians.The attack could possibly be choreographed to look like it was supposedly executed by Ukrainian forces.An even more elaborate Russian operation might try to finger U.S. or NATO forces, rather than Ukrainian forces, as being the perpetrators of such a heinous act, which would almost assuredly include examples of those supposedly killed by the weapons.Such a contrived act would likely take place on Ukrainian territory currently controlled by Russian forces, such as the eastern Ukrainian region of the Donbas. The false flag operation could be used to “change the channel” on Russian brutality in Ukraine in the international information space. Indeed, the Chinese are reportedly parroting this Russian propaganda about weapons labs. A false flag operation could also be used to burnish the image of the Russian armed forces at home, where the Russian people are being fed a steady diet of propaganda about the Ukraine invasion.Even more troubling, the false flag operation could be used to justify an escalation in the use of force and violence in Ukraine.Based on Biden administration statements, likely supported by U.S. and other intelligence, the Kremlin would use any trick in the book to justify its unjustifiable war in Ukraine—including the use of weapons of mass destruction.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust.It’s always chancy to unleash the dogs of war: You never know who they’re going to bite. With Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, all we know for sure is that, regardless of the outcome, the result won’t exactly be rosy for the Russian president. It does seem clear what Mr. Putin thought would happen. For some reason, his Kremlin crowd decided now was the time to swallow Ukraine whole, once and for all. Why?Perhaps it’s because they saw weakness in President Biden, as well as in a tentative cluster of European countries on the other side of Ukraine. He obviously gambled that they’d be unwilling to do much for Ukraine.>>> Germany Has Woken UpAs Mr. Putin massed his military, he thought that either the West would flinch and hand over the country, or Russian forces would invade in a lightning campaign, assassinate all the key government officials on day one or two, and frighten the Ukrainians into capitulation with their show of strength. After the West wouldn’t cut a deal, Mr. Putin rolled the dice on a quick win.Well, here we are in the second week of the two-day invasion, and the Ukrainian flag is still flying.There are still several possible outcomes. If Mr. Putin really wants to win—and since he has risked so much already—it’s too much to expect that he will easily back down. The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust, leaving a devastated country and masses of butchered innocents and refugees in his wake. That, now, is the “best” Mr. Putin can hope for.Here is why the most optimistic outcome for Mr. Putin is still bad news for him. For one, the cost will be astronomical. Mr. Biden, arguably, helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war with reckless energy policies that have oil prices rocketing to as much as $130 a barrel. While oil exports can help pay for the Putin war, the cost isn’t cheap. The protracted conflict is burning through Russian cash.The cost of occupying any wasteland Mr. Putin conquered would be higher. At the same time, the value of the Russian currency is crashing, blazing faster than a Russian helicopter shot down by a stinger missile. And sanctions are going to make doing business worldwide much more difficult.After Ukraine, Mr. Putin might want to move on to other targets including lands where Russia is already a threatening influence—in the Balkans, Moldova, and Georgia, or even NATO territory like the Baltic states. At best, though, the Russian military would have to pause and regroup.NATO, for one, would likely be a much more difficult target. Mr. Putin has inadvertently finished President Trump’s work for him. The allies’ rush to beef up defense capabilities—led by, of all countries, Germany—is surely not a scenario Mr. Putin had hoped for. If the momentum continues, Mr. Putin will face a military stalemate.Further, if this crisis propels America and Europe to face the need to come up with responsible policies that deliver affordable, reliable, and abundant energy without relying on Russia, Mr. Putin will lose his two main weapons to intimidate the West: military and energy blackmail. >>> What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWorse, Mr. Putin’s only remaining friend of consequence is China. That’s like saying the only person who has Jason Voorhees’s back is Freddy Krueger. Beijing can’t be happy it’s had to shill for Mr. Putin’s inexcusable war of aggression. That only makes China look like an accomplice. It can’t bail out the enormous backsliding of the Russian economy.As for President Xi’s claim that he was misled by Mr. Putin: nonsense. Sure, China hopes to avoid blow-back from the anger that the free world is heaping on Moscow, but it’s all in for Russia and will do what it can to help. While this all seems bad for Mr. Putin, it could be an even worse winter in Moscow if Ukrainians continue their heroic stand and his forces can’t conquer the country.None of Mr. Putin’s misery should give us joy. His tragedy was born of greater tragedy. Forty-four million Ukrainians were thrown to the wolves because Mr. Biden couldn’t muster a response to Mr. Putin’s threat.The greatest leaders prevent the wars of tyrants by peace through strength. Mr. Biden looks like the fireman who took a day off and let the arsonist run wild.This piece originally appeared in The Sun \n",

            "title:  The Russian Threat: Bolstering NATO Deterrence at a Critical Time\n",
            "text The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including the United States, rests on the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Russia’s ongoing war of naked aggression against Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which threat should be the focus of NATO’s upcoming strategic concept.The answer is clear: The U.S. must lead the Alliance to a wholesale refocusing on the organization’s raison d’être of collective defense. While the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the fact remains that Russia continues to be the only existential threat to member states. NATO must send a strong signal that it is strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to the increased threat from Russia.Deterrence measures should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of Russia’s position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground, and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued commitment to the NATO treaty’s Article 5.These deterrence measures must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S. must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture must not be to the detriment of the nation’s ability to counter China.From the Arctic to the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable threat to NATO and the interests of its members. For member states in Eastern Europe, Russia represents a real and potentially existential threat. Russia’s entrenched position in Belarus, along with its ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members, in two, scramble the geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern flank.Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine will hopefully be the push that some allies need to finally live up to their commitments to the NATO defense spending benchmark. As an intergovernmental security alliance, NATO is only as strong as its member states. Weak defense spending on the continent has led to a significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing gaps in readiness for NATO allies. As a result, American Presidents of both political parties have long called for increases in defense spending by NATO allies.Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—an attack on one is an attack on all—Article 3 is the most important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3 states that member states, at a minimum, will “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.” Only a handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to their Article 3 commitment.In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense investment, NATO set a target for its 30 member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales Summit, member states recommitted to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and committed to spending 20 percent of their defense budgets on “major equipment” purchases by 2024.NATO allies have made real and sustained increases in defense spending in recent years, but it is far from enough. In 2021, 10 members of the Alliance spent 2 percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20 percent benchmark.REF Procuring capabilities does not happen overnight, and allies in NATO must commit today to investing the necessary political and economic capital to fulfill their Article 3 treaty commitments.U.S. basing structures in Europe harken back to a time when Denmark, West Germany, and Greece represented the front lines of freedom. The security situation in Europe has changed, not least of which due to Russia’s force posture in Belarus and occupied portions of Ukraine. The U.S. must account for this shift by establishing a persistent and continuing military presence in allied nations further east. A robust presence displays the long-term U.S. resolve to live up to its NATO treaty commitments. The U.S. should lead by example, while also encouraging other NATO allies to base forces in Eastern European member states.Over the course of the past few weeks, the U.S. has deployed additional rotational forces in Europe. On Thursday, 7,000 troops from the Army’s First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, deployed to bases in Germany.REF In total, the U.S. has deployed an additional 14,000 troops to Europe in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has also redeployed aircraft further east on a temporary basis, including 20 Apache helicopters (AH-64s) based in Germany deploying to Baltic allies, 12 AH-64s based in Greece deploying to Poland,REF and six F-35 fighter jets from Utah deploying temporarily to bases in Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania.REF Furthermore, two B-52s from the 5th Bomb Wing deployed on a “long-planned Bomber Task Force Europe mission over the Arctic and Baltic Sea regions.”REFEarlier in February, the U.S. deployed 3,000 forces to Poland and Romania to bolster deterrence and aid in preparations for refugees crossing the border from Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that “[t]hese moves are temporary in nature, and are part of the more than 90,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent orders.”Some NATO allies have also increased their presence further east. Germany, which serves as the framework nation in Lithuania for NATO’s enhanced forward presence battalion stationed there, added 350 troops.REF NATO allies have battlegroups stationed in Estonia (U.K.-led), Latvia (Canadian-led), and Poland (U.S.-led); France has offered to lead a similar battalion in Romania, and stated that it is “accelerating” the deployment of forces to the nation.REF On Friday, NATO activated its Very High Readiness Joint Taskforce (VJTF), with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: “We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense.”REF NATO will partially deploy a portion of the VJTF to Eastern Europe; the deployment will include air, land, and naval assets.REFRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine highlights the stark reality that the threat from Russia to NATO is real and enduring. The U.S. and its allies must take immediate steps to bolster collective defense and deter Vladimir Putin from aggression against a NATO member state. In light of the emerging new security reality on the continent, the U.S. should:Russia’s ongoing violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine highlights the importance of NATO and its Article 5 guarantee, as well as the need for a united and robust Alliance posture in Eastern Europe. Both are necessary for sending a clear message to Russia to deter Putin from violating the sovereignty of a NATO member.Daniel Kochis is Senior Policy Analyst in European Affairs in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.

            "title:  In a Period of Brute Force, China Increases Its Military Budget Yet Again\n",
            "text The Chinese Communist Party announced this week it will increase the budget for the People’s Liberation Army by 7.1%.The announcement occurred at the opening session of the National People’s Congress—the annual rubber-stamp parliament. Thus, it is just a matter of time before the extra resources start following to the People’s Liberation Army.This increase continues the trend of sustained increases in the Chinese military budget. Since 2018, the Chinese Communist Party has increased the People’s Liberation Army budget by over 28% with consecutive annual increases of between 8.1% and 6.6%.Contrast this with the U.S. defense budget, which grew little under 5% from 2018 to 2021. However, if you take inflation into account, the U.S. defense budget decreased by 3% in those four years.One of the party’s favorite propaganda vehicles, the Global Times, reported that “the proposed defense budget would mark the single-digit growth for seven consecutive years since 2016 and also a return to a 7-plus percent increase.”The return to an above 7% increase comes after successive years of double-digit growth, ranging from 10.7% to 13% in the earlier part of the 2010s. Further, the People’s Liberation Army is able to get more bang for its buck. As just one example, the Chinese labor costs are substantially lower than American labor costs, enabling them to field a bigger force while spending less.Additionally, China can impose its defense costs on its state-owned companies, shielding the People’s Liberation Army budget from these expenses.By any measure, the Chinese Communist Party has been steadily modernizing and investing in its armed forces with the overall goal of having a fully mechanized and informatized military by 2027.This is an assessment shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in its recently released annual threat assessment, which stated that “Beijing is accelerating the development of key capabilities it believes the People’s Liberation Army’s needs to confront the United States in a large-scale, sustained conflict.”The assessment further elaborates that “China will continue pursuing its goal of building a world-class military that will enable it to secure what it views as its sovereign territory, establish its preeminence in regional affairs, and project power globally while offsetting perceived U.S. military superiority.” Clearly the Intelligence Community believes that the Chinese Communist Party has the will to leverage brute force to impose its ideology, as exemplified by its brutal crackdown in Hong Kong.Today we are watching what an undeterred authoritarian power is capable of doing to subjugate its democratic neighbor in Ukraine, as Russian troops destroy cities and target civilian populations indiscriminately.The United States and the world will be paying close attention to the lessons that Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party leadership will derive from the Western response to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. The Chinese Communist Party is investing in building the capabilities it would need to subjugate and dominate its neighbors.One of the lessons to be learned is that dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin are only deterred by the prospect of a strong military response from determined allies. If we hope to deter China from similarly coercing its neighbors, a strong and capable U.S. military will be necessary.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped to unify Europe against Russia, it has had a divisive effect in the Middle East, where many countries recently have hedged their bets by boosting ties to Moscow to offset declining confidence in U.S. leadership.Even before the Biden administration’s Afghanistan withdrawal debacle last August, U.S. allies and partners in the Middle East were dismayed by a downsizing of the U.S. military presence in the region, incessant talk of an American “pivot” to Asia, and the administration’s commitment to restoring the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.  They rightfully fear that another weak nuclear deal will allow Tehran to pocket billions of dollars and escalate its military and terrorist threats against its neighbors.These reservations about U.S. policy also have hampered cooperation with regional allies and partners on mitigating the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting U.S. sanctions on Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.While announcing the ban on Russian oil imports to the U.S. on Tuesday, President Joe Biden acknowledged that oil prices could surge higher and sought to pin the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin:This decision today is not without costs here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the pump—and this will drive up costs further. So, I will take every step we can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.But Biden’s efforts to lobby for increased oil production from Middle Eastern oil exporters have failed to produce adequate alternatives to the Russian oil.  Washington initially was rebuffed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the only oil exporters that have significant untapped oil production capacity.The two countries announced that they were sticking to an oil production agreement struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC oil producers led by Russia.The United Arab Emirates later moderated its initial position in a statement released on Wednesday by Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba: “We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels.”Gulf Arabs Snub BidenTo make matters worse, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the United Arab Emirates’ Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both recently declined U.S. requests to speak to Biden by phone. Both, however, took phone calls the previous week from Putin.This snub of Biden stands in stark contrast to Saudi behavior in 2018, when it ramped up oil exports to stabilize oil prices after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran.The Saudis and Emiratis feel neglected by the Biden administration, which they assess has failed to adequately respond to mounting threats to their security posed by Iran and its proxy militias.   Both governments were stung by Biden’s criticism of their military intervention in Yemen, the freezing of some U.S. arms sales to their armed forces, and the withdrawal last year of U.S. military forces and missile defenses from their countries at a time when they face rising threats from Iranian drones and missiles, including many launched by Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen.The Biden administration also burned its bridges to the crown prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Biden promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to treat the crown prince as a pariah for his role in the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The Biden administration’s cold shoulder encouraged the Saudis and Emiratis to hedge their bets on U.S. security guarantees by trying to improve their relations with Russia, China, and even Iran.Time to recalibrate U.S. Mideast policyAlthough the Biden administration has been quick to blame Putin for spiking global energy prices, its own flawed energy policies also have contributed to the current energy predicament. The administration has undermined U.S. energy security in its rush to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources that will not be scaling up fast enough to support that transition anytime soon. That trade-off has now become more visible.The Biden administration’s reported overtures to Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for increased oil supplies have rightfully raised eyebrows. This objectionable option could have been avoided if the administration had maintained better relations with major Arab oil kingdoms.The Biden administration needs to recalibrate its Middle East policy to give a higher priority to energy security and the need to deter and defend against a broad spectrum of Iranian threats to regional security.   Perhaps then it could depend on the full cooperation of long-term partners in the Middle East who have harbored increasing doubts about U.S. security guarantees. Maybe then they would even agree to accept a phone call from the White House.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text Last week, amid Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine and the rapid passage of a massive 2,741-page, $1.5 trillion spending bill, it’s not surprising that enactment of a postal reform bill (H.R. 3076) got little attention.Touted as a long-awaited “bipartisan” measure, the postal legislation, 15 years in gestation, is anything but noncontroversial.Fast-tracked through Congress, the bill shifts tens of billions of dollars in liabilities from what is supposed to be the “self-financing” U.S. Postal Service to federal taxpayers.If the Postal Service had a company name like “JP Morgan” one could imagine how such a bailout would have drawn immediate opposition from across the political spectrum.   How did such a thing happen? Here’s how this little drama unfolded:Act 1, Scene 1:  House Fast-Tracks Passage  On Feb. 8, with the support of the Biden administration and the powerful postal unions, the House of Representatives passed the Postal Reform Act by a vote of 342 to 92. One might have expected that House Republicans would have at least had second thoughts, but instead, 120 House Republicans joined the Democratic majority.  Act 2, Scene 1: Sen. Scott’s ObjectionThe House bill appeared to be on a smooth glide path to Senate passage. But Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., raised fiscal concerns, requested the Senate take a closer look at the bill, and said he would offer an amendment.So, on Feb. 14, when the bill was brought to the Senate floor for consideration under the Senate’s unanimous consent rule, Scott objected.He did so for good reason: The Postal Service had accumulated tens of billions of dollars in unfunded obligations for postal retiree health costs. (In 2020, the Government Accountability Office estimated those costs at $75 billion.)With the legislative reorganization of Postal Service health care financing, those very real costs do not simply disappear. Instead, the House bill  shifts those costs onto the taxpayer by dumping them onto the financially troubled Medicare program.In explaining his objection, Scott told his colleagues that he simply wanted the Congressional Budget Office to examine the long-term impact of such a major cost shift on the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. And, as Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., noted, there was no Senate hearing on this measure, nor any Senate debate at all.Scott’s objection was reasonable. While the U.S. Postal Service has been bleeding billions of dollars for years, Medicare, the huge federal health program serving senior citizens, is also in serious financial trouble. In four short years, Medicare’s huge hospital program faces insolvency, meaning that, unless Congress acts, Medicare patients face serious benefit payment cuts.Medicare spending is accelerating at warp speed, and it, too, is generating an enormous taxpayer debt in the form of long-term unfunded obligations.Medicare’s trustees estimate the program’s long-term unfunded obligations at $48.3 trillion, the dollar amount of benefits promised, but not financed. That is equivalent to $150,000 per American.More to Scott’s point, with Medicare spending accelerating, piling on billions of dollars of additional unfunded obligations is pouring gasoline on Medicare’s fiscal fires.The House postal bill also imposes a costly mandate on postal retirees. Because the bill forces future postal retirees out of the superior Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) into traditional Medicare for primary coverage, they would now have to buy supplemental coverage, and pay two premiums rather than one, to fill crucial benefit gaps, including catastrophic coverage.This supplemental coverage fuels excess demand and drives up Medicare beneficiary and taxpayer costs even more.Act 2, Scene 2: CBO ReportWhile the CBO did not account for these unfunded obligations in its estimate, or the House bill’s budgetary effects for the next 20 years, as Scott requested, the senator learned from the CBO that the bill would add at least $5 billion to the nation’s deficits.The CBO also dropped a nasty bomblet. It said that, even with enactment of the House bill, it was still “unclear” how the Postal Service would pay for its “ongoing obligations” for health care, including health care for its retirees, after 2031.Act 2, Scene 3: Scott’s AmendmentCongressional bill sponsors simply ignored or downplayed the Medicare cost issue.So, Scott announced a simple amendment: In any transition of postal retirees to full Medicare coverage, the Postal Service should be required to reimburse the Medicare program for any additional costs.If the Medicare cost issue was not a problem, then logically there could be no objection.   The Postal Service, as noted, is supposed to be a self–financing agency. It is, of course, failing as a self-financing agency, running up billions of dollars in annual deficits, and accumulating, according to the GAO, a breathtaking $188 billion (about $580 per person in the U.S.) in debt.That debt includes, of course, its huge unfunded health and pension obligations. In short, the agency is a financial mess.In offering his amendment, Scott asked his Senate colleagues in effect whether America’s taxpayers should be targeted for such a massive cost-shift—a cost-shift that is justified only by the agency’s notorious financial failures.   Act 3, Scene 1: Senate Floor VotesOn March 8, the Senate took up the postal reform bill.Under the prevailing Senate rule, Scott asked for unanimous consent for the Senate to consider and vote on his amendment to require the Postal Service to reimburse the Medicare program for the additional Medicare costs.Johnson, along with Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla.; Mike Braun, R-Ind.;  and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, cosponsored the amendment. Senate Democrats then objected, and blocked consideration of, and a vote on, the Scott amendment.As noted, the CBO confirmed the bill would add to the deficit. So, Scott then made a “point of order” against the bill because it violated the Senate’s budget rules. In response, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,  a socialist, made a motion that the Senate waive the budget rules to advance the House bill. Remarkably, Sanders’ motion passed by a vote of 68 to 30, garnering support from a surprising number of Republican senators.After blocking debate on Scott’s amendment and waiving the budget rules, the Senate passed the House postal bill by a lopsided 79-19 vote.Alas, conscientious lawmakers are often in the minority.    CurtainsThough the postal reform debate is over, at least for now, Scott’s performance was a profile in statesmanship.The senator knows that the bigger and broader Medicare debate is inevitable, and that Medicare’s future financial stability is essential to fulfilling its promise to deliver high-quality care to a large and growing cohort of senior citizens.Medicare reform will soon be among America’s greatest policy challenges.Scott also reminded his colleagues that throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at a problem is not a solution.Bailouts are no substitute for real postal reform, as Heritage analysts have long insisted, and taxpayers’ pockets are not inexhaustible. Maybe next time, they will listen.This piece originally appeared in \n",

            "text Since 2002, the United States Air Force has been on a fitful path to recapitalization of its fleet of air refueling aircraft, which now average 55 years old.REF In an effort to save money, it has reduced its fleet size by retiring aging tankers without suitable replacements. It also has based its future tanker capacity requirements on regional rather than peer-level threats. As it continues to wrestle with a replacement tanker that has experienced considerable delays, the service should:The Air Force began a process to replace its fleet of KC-135 and KC-10 tankers in 2001 with a controversial sole-source proposal that involved both buying and leasing new aircraft from the Boeing Corporation. That program was terminated in 2005 after corruption related to Boeing’s lease proposal was uncovered.REFFollowing that inauspicious start, in 2006, the Air Force issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a highly capable, medium-sized, low-risk, and low-cost tanker to replace the oldest KC-135s in the inventory.REF The two vendors that submitted proposals were the Boeing Corporation and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus at the time, in partnership with Northrup-Grumman. EADS won the contract, but shortly after the award, Boeing filed a formal protest.REF Many in Congress voiced their concerns to the Office of the Secretary of Defense about the award of a major weapons system to a foreign company,REF and in 2008, Secretary Robert Gates terminated the program.REF After a cooling-off period, the Air Force revised the requirements and requested a new set of proposals for its next tanker.The cost of Boeing’s submission in that round of competition reportedly was less than the cost of the EADS submission, and in 2011, the Air Force awarded Boeing a contract to modify its already successful 767 airliner into the KC-46A air refueling platform and deliver a total of 179 tankers in a program that would become known as KC-X.REF The first seven jets were to be delivered in 2015; 18 were to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) by August 2017;REF and the last six were to be acquired in 2027.REFOver the years, the initiative to replace the tanker fleet has morphed into three incremental acquisition programs known as KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z. KC-X acquisition will be completed with the last KC-46A delivery; KC-Y, also known as the Bridge Tanker, was initially intended to replace the KC-10s and a tranche of older KC-135s beginning in 2029; and the KC-Z will replace the remaining KC-135s at some point in the future.REFThe KC-X program has suffered several technical and production challenges, and the Air Force is now on track to accept the last of the KC-46s in 2029 after a three-year delay. To continue the seamless replacement of its aging tankers, the service intends to solicit proposals for KC-Y by the end of 2022 with the intent of receiving the first of as many as 160 tankers in 2029.REFThe KC-46 was designed to refuel both Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps aircraft, and the difference between these two systems are significant.Air Force tanker booms can be configured to fly with a drogue/basket (only) to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, or they can fly with two additional drogue/basket pods mounted on the wings, allowing the tanker to refuel either type of aircraft on the same mission. C-130s can be configured with drogue/basket systems to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, but their offload capacity is much lower because the airframe is smaller and therefore carries less fuel.For the purposes of this paper, C-130s are referred to as tactical air refueling systems, and KC-135, KC-10, KC-46, and KC-Y systems are referred to as strategic air refueling systems/tankers. Before the service begins the selection process for the KC-Y, it is important that the status of the KC-X program and the challenges that have characterized deliveries of the KC-46A be understood.To date, more than 60 KC-46s have been delivered, but even at the most basic level, the program has been marred by a string of system design problems and production faults. The KC-46 design incorporated the concept for a Remote Vision System (RVS) that molds video from multiple cameras at the rear of the plane to create a two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) vision system, allowing the boom operator to sit in the main cabin and refuel the aircraft remotely.During flight testing in 2016 and 2017, aircrew identified several major issues with the RVS and the aircraft’s refueling boom that inhibit the KC-46A from executing its primary mission: refueling other aircraft.REF The jet’s boom was too stiff, which proved to be problematic for fueling lighter aircraft like A-10s and F-16s.REF Problems surrounding the RVS were first reported as issues surrounding a “sunlight glare” during certain times of the day, but the challenge is much deeper.The RVS 2D/3D, black-and-white cameras are mounted at the rear of the KC-46, just behind the aircraft’s boom. While the camera image can wash out during certain sun angles, even when paired with the jet’s 3D goggles, the system does not give boomers the depth perception they need to conduct normal air refueling operations. Stunningly, the system often fails to capture or display the length of the telescopic boom as it extends to make contact with receiver aircraft.REFThe alignment of the RVS cameras in relation to the air refueling boom’s outer tubeREF effectively obscures or masks the last several feet of the telescoping portion of the boom,REF including the refueling probe that makes contact with the refueling receptacles of receiver aircraft.REF If the lighting/sun angle is right, the system can pick up the end of the boom’s shadow on top of the receiving aircraft. This work-around gives boomers the opportunity to gauge the position of the tip of the boom before attempting to connect to receiving aircraft. However, it also assumes the best of conditions, and when viewed in context with current refueling procedures, its associated challenges become glaringly obvious.The refueling receptacle for the F-16 is located several feet behind the cockpit and is not visible to pilots flying those single-seat fighters. Refueling procedures for the F-16 call for the pilots to fly to a position directly in line with the end of the tanker’s boom and then move forward directly toward the end of the probe. As the distance between the end of the boom and the jet’s canopy closes, the boomer uses his depth perception to judge when to move the boom around and then directly behind the F-16’s canopy to make contact with the jet’s refueling receptacle. With questionable depth perception, no reliable ability to see the end of the boom, and no usable surface area in front of the canopy to catch the boom’s shadow, attempting to refuel an F-16 with the KC-46’s RVS system during daytime in clear weather conditions is challenging.In addition, during heavy weather or clear-air turbulence, the tanker and receiver aircraft can move up and down rapidly without warning, often in opposing cycles. Attempting to make a refueling connection without relevant depth perception and without being able to see the end of the boom under those conditions elevates what would otherwise be a benign procedure to one that is mishap-prone, even with the most experienced boomers.While the technical challenges with the boom and RVS are troubling, issues with basic workmanship are equally illuminating. In February 2019, an internal Boeing management memo noted that Air Force pilots were finding so much debris and so many loose tools throughout brand-new jets that “they will not fly [them] due to the FOD (foreign object debris) issues and the current [lack of] confidence they have in our product….”REFBoeing was able to win the KC-X contract primarily because it met three criteria: cost, preservation of the U.S. industrial base for tankers, and previous experience in building the KC-135. While noble in design, all three criteria have delivered poor outcomes for the KC-X acquisition program.Boeing reportedly underbid EADS in a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract that made it financially responsible for cost overruns. To date, the company has absorbed some $5.4 billion in cost overrunsREF that otherwise would have been borne by the government through a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.FFP contracts work well for proven systems or for those with very high technology readiness levels (TRLs), but the design for the KC-46’s RVS system met neither of those criteria. On the surface, Boeing’s FFP contract for the KC-X effectively limited a great deal of financial risk to the government, but it also has caused a significant amount of operational risk. Forcing or even allowing a contractor to insert a low-TRL system under such an agreement can put contractors in dire financial straits, and the collateral effects within this effort have exposed the government to operational risks with enormous attendant costs.Eleven years after the KC-X contract was awarded, the Air Force is accepting aircraft that are years away from having a viable operational capability, and the program remains anything but low risk. The new tanker is prohibited from supporting real-world contingency operations, and the jet’s initial operating capability (IOC) date has slipped to fiscal year (FY) 2024 at the earliest.REF By that time, the Air Force will have taken possession of some 103 KC-46s.REFThe Air Force estimates that the fix for the boom and RVS should be ready by the spring of 2024,REF but the shortcuts the service is taking to make that timeline are eye-opening. The problems with the current system were discovered during flight testing, yet the Air Force has decided not to assess or flight test the fully revised RVS before it accepts the design.REF Problems discovered beyond that point could result in even more significant delays, and the costs for fixing the system will be borne by the Air Force.Assuming the redesign goes as planned, retrofitting jets that the service has already accepted with the boom and RVS redesign will take several years, and the operational impact of that process will be significant: 103 strategic air refueling assets will be unusable in real-world operations in 2024. That number will grow to 110 jets in 2025, equating to 23 percent of the fleet that will be unable to fulfill operational taskings. Assuming that the design and retrofit stay on track, the numbers will slowly start to improve through 2029 when all KC-46s will be fully operational.REFRecognizing the gap in operational capability, Congress, through the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), directed the Air Force to slow or curtail the retirement of viable tanker aircraft until the KC-46 comes up to speed.REF Unfortunately, that move has introduced still other challenges. As the service continues to accept new KC-46s, the squadrons and crews that transition to those jets are no longer available to fly the operationally capable KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The Air Force is studying methods for filling those cockpits and covering the operational gapsREF by hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is retiring. However, while this option may buy down operational risk, it will undoubtedly impose a significant financial burden on the Air Force.Because crews that transition to the KC-46 need to continue training, the service moved last year to meet that need as well as to relieve KC-10 and KC-135 operational tempo where possible. The Air Force approved the KC-46A for stateside operations and refueling missions in support of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM); for aircraft that employ probe/drogue refueling (Navy/Marine Corps fighters); and for 11 Air Force platforms.REF The list does not include the F-35, F-22, or B-2 because of the likelihood of the KC-46 RVS/boom system’s errantly damaging the stealth coatings on those jets. Commanders may elect to waive that restriction during contingency or wartime operations, but they will have to accept the increased operational risk.Boeing is at least seven years away from delivering 179 fully operational KC-46s, and risks to the service and its wartime mission between now and 2029 will be significant. It is important to keep those lessons in mind as the Air Force moves to acquire the next increment of tankers, particularly in light of recent events and the possibility that they might escalate into great-power conflict. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced even the most dovish nations within NATO to revise their defense spending to ready their nations for a possible conflict with Russia,REF and the Commander of Indo-Pacific Command has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that China could move on Taiwan by 2027.REF The potential for great-power conflict is growing, and the United States needs to acquire the capacity to fight such a war.Later this year, the Air Force will release an RFP for the next increment of 150 strategic tankers. Both the Boeing Corporation and Lockheed Martin/Airbus are expected to submit proposals that are designed to capture the KC-Y contract. Boeing is expected to offer the KC-46A that is currently in production in the United States. The Airbus/Lockheed Martin KC-Y proposal, named the Lockheed Martin Next Generation Tanker or LMXT, will be a modified version of Airbus’s A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).The MRTT is already operational and has been certified to refuel every fighter aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and Navy inventories. It has a boom enhanced vision system (BEVS) with 3D, high-definition color displays that allow boomers to sit in the main cabin and remotely refuel other aircraft. BEVS was designed to enable automated air refueling (refueling without a boom operator) using machine vision algorithms. That sub-system is on track to be certified for automatic daytime refueling later in 2022 and nighttime refueling in 2023. Based on the Airbus A-330 airliner, the MRTT design will be modified to increase its fuel capacity.Both the KC-46 and the LMXT have cargoREF and passenger carriage capabilities and are designed to accept high-end command and control equipment to further the Air Battle Management System/Joint Air Domain Command and Control network efforts. However, those capabilities are secondary to the air refueling mission, and the RFP and follow-on acquisition decision process must prioritize those capabilities accordingly.While the overarching tanker acquisition strategy has morphed over the years, the KC-Y Bridge Tanker program was initially designed to replace the KC-10, a jet that can carry significantly more fuel than the KC-135 carries. The distances and fuel offload capacity required to establish a tanker bridge and sustain operations from the United States to the area of operations would be much greater in a peer fight with China than they would be in a fight with Russia. That fact, coupled with China’s intent to target any tanker base within range of its air-to-surface missile systems, makes fuel offload capacity at range a critical capability. The KC-10 carries a maximum of 356,000 pounds of fuel, which is 70 percent more than either the KC-135 or KC-46 can carry, but it burns fuel at a much higher rate than the KC-135, KC46, or LMXT. The KC-135 has a capacity of 200,000 pounds, and the KC-46 can carry 211,000 pounds,REF but the LMXT can carry 268,445 pounds.REFThe operational effects of that additional capacity are not insignificant. In real terms, the LMXT could refuel seven more F-35s than the KC-46 can refuel when the offload point (Air Refueling Contact Point or ARCP) is 1,000 miles from the tanker’s launch and recovery base, six more at an operating radius of 2,000 miles, and five more at 3,000 miles. The LMXT and KC-10 can offload the same amount of fuel at 2,500 miles, but from that point on, because of its more efficient engines, the LMXT can offload more than even the KC-10 is able to offload.REFThe LMXT’s increased capacity and proven track record make it a viable contender in this competition. Because the KC-46 is smaller than the LMXT, it conceivably could operate out of more bases in the Pacific region when both aircraft are loaded to their maximum gross weights. When both aircraft are loaded to the same gross weights, however, the LMXT can fly out of more airfields because of its more powerful engines. Assuming that the issues with its boom and RVS are resolved in due course, the KC-46 will be a serious contender, but it will take years for those issues to be resolved, and acquiring an additional 150 Pegasus platforms before the fix has been accepted would therefore be unwise. Delaying the KC-Y acquisition decision until the KC-46 becomes operational is an option, but such a delay would levy even more risk on an already strained tanker fleet.Pressure from Members of Congress and industrial partners to embrace that risk and fall back on the same cost savings and buy-American criteria that got the service in trouble with the KC-X program will undoubtedly be high. Both sticker price and preservation of an organic American industrial base for tankers are important considerations, but as previously noted, the costs associated with filling the operational gaps created by the KC-46 RVS and boom issues are likewise important. Perhaps as a sign that Airbus/Lockheed Martin learned from their previous proposal, they now have plans to assemble the A-330 airframe in Mobile, Alabama, and modify it into the LMXT tanker in Marietta, Georgia.Finally, the critical technology within the LMXT proposal is already operational and at work in dozens of fielded MRTT platforms, which means the risk associated with acquiring this system would be minimal. The Bridge Tanker acquisition decision is a critical one, and it will be important for the service to go through the acquisition process by the book and avoid the gaffes and resets that it suffered with the KC-X in the mid-2000s. The service needs as many operational booms as it can field for a possible fight with China—even more capacity than it currently is programmed to acquire.By the end of the KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z acquisition programs, the Air Force will have replaced all KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft with new and more capable tankers while reducing the total number of strategic refueling platforms from 479 to 457. That number is woefully insufficient for a peer fight, based on the recent history of real-world operations as well as formal tanker requirement studies.In both 1991 and 2003, the Air Force possessed some 600 KC-135 and KC-10 tankers.REF When the service executed Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, it employed some 271 tankers to support the airbridge to the Persian Gulf as well as combat operations in Iraq.REF Twelve years later, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the demand for Air Force tankers peaked at 319 and then leveled off to a continual demand of 280 (95 airbridge and 185 combat support)—a number that did not include tankers from sister services or allies.REFWith today’s inventory of 479 aircraft, that daily tanker support requirement for a regional war against a Third World adversary would consume 58 percent of our current fleet, and that number does not include combat losses, tankers required to defend the homeland or support deterrence operations in a second theater, or tankers held in reserve to support nuclear strike operations. According to a recent Hudson Institute study, this could mean an additional 325 tankers,REF which, when combined with the sustained Operation Iraqi Freedom requirement of 280 tankers, equates to a capacity requirement of 605 strategic air refueling aircraft.While those numbers are significant, the airbridge and combat support requirements for a peer fight, particularly one conducted in the threat environment and over the vast distances associated with a fight with China, would likely dwarf that number. A U.S. Department of Defense Study completed in 2001 concluded that “500–600 KC-135R equivalents” were needed “to meet the National Military Strategy,” and a 2005 Mobility Capabilities Study “reportedly recommended the acquisition of 520–640 KC-135R model equivalents.”REF Both of those studies were conducted long before the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) directed the services to prepare for great-power competition with China or Russia.REFSeven months after the 2018 NDS was released, the Secretary of the Air Force released “The Air Force We Need,” a study examining the capacity the service would need to support that strategy. Based on thousands of war-game simulations, the study found that the service would need 14 more tanker squadrons than the 40 it had at the time,REF which equates to a total of 691 strategic refueling platforms.REFAlthough the service has backed away from the study because of the associated cost, it remains the most accurate estimate we have for the tanker requirements associated with great-power competition. Other alliances with other nations may bring additional fighter capacity to such a fight, but almost every nation will need the strategic tanker support that only the Air Force can bring.The Air Force should increase its capacity requirement to match the approximately 691 tankers recommended in “The Air Force We Need,” and now is an excellent time to begin. As previously noted, the Air Force is studying methods for covering the operational gaps caused by delays associated with the KC-46. One option would be to shift “retiring” active-duty air refueling assets to the Reserve Component. This would undoubtedly be less expensive than a commercial option, and the assets and crews would have no geographic constraint on where they could fly in times of war.Hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is moving to retire might also be a viable option. While constraints on where those leased platforms could fly would be an issue, the option would allow the service to build the 691-tanker capacity requirement for a peer fight, satisfy congressional concerns, and allow the service to continue or even accelerate its programmed retirements of the KC-10 and KC-135 tanker fleets.REFCongress should:For its part, the Air Force should:The Air Force should move immediately to strengthen the path to recapitalization of its fleet of strategic air refueling aircraft through seamless competition, both to incentivize performance within and to expand the tanker industrial base. The Defense Department should maintain the current proposal and acquisition schedule for the KC-Y, and the award should prioritize proven performance and the minimization of risk. The retirement of viable tanker aircraft fleet should end until operational replacements are in place, and the Air Force should increase its air refueling capacity from 479 to 691 owned or leased tankers to ensure that it is better prepared for possible conflict with a peer competitor.John Venable is Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy in the Center for National Defense, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.\n",

            "text In the latest in a series of specious and outlandish justifications for its illegal, immoral, and brutal invasion of sovereign Ukraine, Russia is claiming that Washington and Kyiv are working together to develop chemical and biological weapons.Pure Putin propaganda.Indeed, according to the U.S. State Department this week:The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.On the other hand, the State Department notes:It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.No surprises in that State Department claim, considering that Russian operatives have used the Novichok nerve agent to attack former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and Russian political dissident Alexei Navalny in recent years.Russia has also shamelessly supported the regime of Syria’s Bashar Assad, which has used a variety of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in the brutal civil war there. With the war in Ukraine in a stalemate that includes significant losses for the Russian forces in the face of stiff Ukrainian political and military resistance, Russia is looking for ways to reenergize its political and military campaign to subjugate Ukraine.To do this, Moscow might develop a “false flag” operation, involving the use of chemical (or less likely biological) weapons in Ukraine against Russian forces, ethnic Russians in Ukraine, or even Ukrainian civilians.The attack could possibly be choreographed to look like it was supposedly executed by Ukrainian forces.An even more elaborate Russian operation might try to finger U.S. or NATO forces, rather than Ukrainian forces, as being the perpetrators of such a heinous act, which would almost assuredly include examples of those supposedly killed by the weapons.Such a contrived act would likely take place on Ukrainian territory currently controlled by Russian forces, such as the eastern Ukrainian region of the Donbas. The false flag operation could be used to “change the channel” on Russian brutality in Ukraine in the international information space. Indeed, the Chinese are reportedly parroting this Russian propaganda about weapons labs. A false flag operation could also be used to burnish the image of the Russian armed forces at home, where the Russian people are being fed a steady diet of propaganda about the Ukraine invasion.Even more troubling, the false flag operation could be used to justify an escalation in the use of force and violence in Ukraine.Based on Biden administration statements, likely supported by U.S. and other intelligence, the Kremlin would use any trick in the book to justify its unjustifiable war in Ukraine—including the use of weapons of mass destruction.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

Russia’s ongoing war of naked aggression against Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which threat should be the focus of NATO’s upcoming strategic concept.The answer is clear: The U.S. must lead the Alliance to a wholesale refocusing on the organization’s raison d’être of collective defense. While the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the fact remains that Russia continues to be the only existential threat to member states. NATO must send a strong signal that it is strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to the increased threat from Russia.Deterrence measures should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of Russia’s position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground, and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued commitment to the NATO treaty’s Article 5.These deterrence measures must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S. must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture must not be to the detriment of the nation’s ability to counter China.From the Arctic to the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable threat to NATO and the interests of its members. For member states in Eastern Europe, Russia represents a real and potentially existential threat. Russia’s entrenched position in Belarus, along with its ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members, in two, scramble the geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern flank.Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine will hopefully be the push that some allies need to finally live up to their commitments to the NATO defense spending benchmark. As an intergovernmental security alliance, NATO is only as strong as its member states. Weak defense spending on the continent has led to a significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing gaps in readiness for NATO allies. As a result, American Presidents of both political parties have long called for increases in defense spending by NATO allies.Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—an attack on one is an attack on all—Article 3 is the most important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3 states that member states, at a minimum, will “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.” Only a handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to their Article 3 commitment.In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense investment, NATO set a target for its 30 member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales Summit, member states recommitted to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and committed to spending 20 percent of their defense budgets on “major equipment” purchases by 2024.NATO allies have made real and sustained increases in defense spending in recent years, but it is far from enough. In 2021, 10 members of the Alliance spent 2 percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20 percent benchmark.REF Procuring capabilities does not happen overnight, and allies in NATO must commit today to investing the necessary political and economic capital to fulfill their Article 3 treaty commitments.U.S. basing structures in Europe harken back to a time when Denmark, West Germany, and Greece represented the front lines of freedom. The security situation in Europe has changed, not least of which due to Russia’s force posture in Belarus and occupied portions of Ukraine. The U.S. must account for this shift by establishing a persistent and continuing military presence in allied nations further east. A robust presence displays the long-term U.S. resolve to live up to its NATO treaty commitments. The U.S. should lead by example, while also encouraging other NATO allies to base forces in Eastern European member states.Over the course of the past few weeks, the U.S. has deployed additional rotational forces in Europe. On Thursday, 7,000 troops from the Army’s First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, deployed to bases in Germany.REF In total, the U.S. has deployed an additional 14,000 troops to Europe in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has also redeployed aircraft further east on a temporary basis, including 20 Apache helicopters (AH-64s) based in Germany deploying to Baltic allies, 12 AH-64s based in Greece deploying to Poland,REF and six F-35 fighter jets from Utah deploying temporarily to bases in Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania.REF Furthermore, two B-52s from the 5th Bomb Wing deployed on a “long-planned Bomber Task Force Europe mission over the Arctic and Baltic Sea regions.”REFEarlier in February, the U.S. deployed 3,000 forces to Poland and Romania to bolster deterrence and aid in preparations for refugees crossing the border from Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that “[t]hese moves are temporary in nature, and are part of the more than 90,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent orders.”Some NATO allies have also increased their presence further east. Germany, which serves as the framework nation in Lithuania for NATO’s enhanced forward presence battalion stationed there, added 350 troops.REF NATO allies have battlegroups stationed in Estonia (U.K.-led), Latvia (Canadian-led), and Poland (U.S.-led); France has offered to lead a similar battalion in Romania, and stated that it is “accelerating” the deployment of forces to the nation.REF On Friday, NATO activated its Very High Readiness Joint Taskforce (VJTF), with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: “We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense.”REF NATO will partially deploy a portion of the VJTF to Eastern Europe; the deployment will include air, land, and naval assets.REFRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine highlights the stark reality that the threat from Russia to NATO is real and enduring. The U.S. and its allies must take immediate steps to bolster collective defense and deter Vladimir Putin from aggression against a NATO member state. In light of the emerging new security reality on the continent, the U.S. should:Russia’s ongoing violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine highlights the importance of NATO and its Article 5 guarantee, as well as the need for a united and robust Alliance posture in Eastern Europe. Both are necessary for sending a clear message to Russia to deter Putin from violating the sovereignty of a NATO member.Daniel Kochis is Senior Policy Analyst in European Affairs in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.

            "title:  Putin’s Dangerous Nuclear Brinkmanship in Ukraine\n",
            "text Most Americans view nuclear weapons as a relic of the Cold War. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed in 1985 “that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.” That thinking has remained a “given” for the last 37 years. Unfortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin may have other ideas.Just five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin personally oversaw nuclear exercises and issued subtle nuclear threats against the West should Ukraine become a part of NATO. Once his war begun, the threats became less subtle. More recently, Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert. While the Pentagon reports it has not detected significant changes in Russia’s nuclear posture, Putin’s nuclear muscle flexing has prompted concern over how far he will go.A Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine—or worse, against a NATO state—is unlikely. Doing so would break a 75-year nuclear taboo while completely alienating the rest of the world from Russia. But the chances are not zero, either. The U.S. must take the threat seriously.>>> Russia Links Ukraine Sanctions to Iran Nuclear Talks to Shake Down Biden AdministrationWhen it comes to nuclear long-range missiles—those able to reach each other’s homelands—the U.S. and Russia have rough parity stemming from the New START arms control treaty. But Russia also has more than 2,000 low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons that are meant for use on a battlefield. In this category, Russia’s weapons outnumber the U.S. at least 10 to 1.The prevailing American view is that nuclear weapons should be used only for deterrence. But Russia’s official warfighting doctrine specifically reserves the right to use tactical nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict to compel the enemy to back down.Here’s where the nuclear danger comes in. If Russia continues to fail in its conventional military efforts to seize Ukrainian cities and topple the Ukrainian government, Putin might be tempted to fire a tactical nuclear weapon to compel Ukrainians to surrender and signal to the West that he will not take failure as an option.A nuclear attack on Ukraine, even with a very small nuclear weapon, would cause severe destruction and take thousands of lives if launched at a populated area. While NATO would not be obliged to respond militarily, such an attack would likely lead to further Russian isolation from the world and unite countries against Putin.A nuclear attack on a NATO state is less likely. Putin knows any nuclear attack will be met with a nuclear response. But short of launching a nuclear weapon at a NATO state, Putin may issue further nuclear threats against NATO intervention in Ukraine.Indeed, Putin’s order to move Russia’s nuclear weapons on higher alert was likely meant to scare away the West from getting involved. Or, if Ukraine continues to repel Russian forces, Putin may threaten nuclear attack to compel the West to stop sending military equipment to Ukraine.>>>What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWar against a major nuclear power—especially one that views nuclear weapons as “useable”—introduces complexities into the fight and forces the United States and its allies to proceed with caution. But by the same measure, NATO is a nuclear alliance, too. To deter nuclear war with Russia, NATO must be sure to communicate its resolve to use nuclear weapons if attacked.Moving forward, the United States must ensure that a strong nuclear deterrence is at the top of its agenda. After the Cold War, the United States retired thousands of nuclear weapons while letting its existing forces become older and older. Now, the U.S. is scrambling to replace its nuclear forces with modern systems before they age into obsolescence.Putin’s recent inflammatory rhetoric, nuclear saber-rattling and military actions in Ukraine are proof of the need for a strong, modern U.S. nuclear force. Indeed, the nuclear dangers in Ukraine have taught us that nuclear war is a 21st century concern. As much as U.S. policymakers might like to wish away nuclear weapons from existence, unfortunately, the enemy gets a vote.This piece originally appeared in MSN.com \n",

            "text Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped to unify Europe against Russia, it has had a divisive effect in the Middle East, where many countries recently have hedged their bets by boosting ties to Moscow to offset declining confidence in U.S. leadership.Even before the Biden administration’s Afghanistan withdrawal debacle last August, U.S. allies and partners in the Middle East were dismayed by a downsizing of the U.S. military presence in the region, incessant talk of an American “pivot” to Asia, and the administration’s commitment to restoring the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.  They rightfully fear that another weak nuclear deal will allow Tehran to pocket billions of dollars and escalate its military and terrorist threats against its neighbors.These reservations about U.S. policy also have hampered cooperation with regional allies and partners on mitigating the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting U.S. sanctions on Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.While announcing the ban on Russian oil imports to the U.S. on Tuesday, President Joe Biden acknowledged that oil prices could surge higher and sought to pin the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin:This decision today is not without costs here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the pump—and this will drive up costs further. So, I will take every step we can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.But Biden’s efforts to lobby for increased oil production from Middle Eastern oil exporters have failed to produce adequate alternatives to the Russian oil.  Washington initially was rebuffed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the only oil exporters that have significant untapped oil production capacity.The two countries announced that they were sticking to an oil production agreement struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC oil producers led by Russia.The United Arab Emirates later moderated its initial position in a statement released on Wednesday by Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba: “We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels.”Gulf Arabs Snub BidenTo make matters worse, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the United Arab Emirates’ Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both recently declined U.S. requests to speak to Biden by phone. Both, however, took phone calls the previous week from Putin.This snub of Biden stands in stark contrast to Saudi behavior in 2018, when it ramped up oil exports to stabilize oil prices after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran.The Saudis and Emiratis feel neglected by the Biden administration, which they assess has failed to adequately respond to mounting threats to their security posed by Iran and its proxy militias.   Both governments were stung by Biden’s criticism of their military intervention in Yemen, the freezing of some U.S. arms sales to their armed forces, and the withdrawal last year of U.S. military forces and missile defenses from their countries at a time when they face rising threats from Iranian drones and missiles, including many launched by Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen.The Biden administration also burned its bridges to the crown prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Biden promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to treat the crown prince as a pariah for his role in the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The Biden administration’s cold shoulder encouraged the Saudis and Emiratis to hedge their bets on U.S. security guarantees by trying to improve their relations with Russia, China, and even Iran.Time to recalibrate U.S. Mideast policyAlthough the Biden administration has been quick to blame Putin for spiking global energy prices, its own flawed energy policies also have contributed to the current energy predicament. The administration has undermined U.S. energy security in its rush to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources that will not be scaling up fast enough to support that transition anytime soon. That trade-off has now become more visible.The Biden administration’s reported overtures to Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for increased oil supplies have rightfully raised eyebrows. This objectionable option could have been avoided if the administration had maintained better relations with major Arab oil kingdoms.The Biden administration needs to recalibrate its Middle East policy to give a higher priority to energy security and the need to deter and defend against a broad spectrum of Iranian threats to regional security.   Perhaps then it could depend on the full cooperation of long-term partners in the Middle East who have harbored increasing doubts about U.S. security guarantees. Maybe then they would even agree to accept a phone call from the White House.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust.It’s always chancy to unleash the dogs of war: You never know who they’re going to bite. With Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, all we know for sure is that, regardless of the outcome, the result won’t exactly be rosy for the Russian president. It does seem clear what Mr. Putin thought would happen. For some reason, his Kremlin crowd decided now was the time to swallow Ukraine whole, once and for all. Why?Perhaps it’s because they saw weakness in President Biden, as well as in a tentative cluster of European countries on the other side of Ukraine. He obviously gambled that they’d be unwilling to do much for Ukraine.>>> Germany Has Woken UpAs Mr. Putin massed his military, he thought that either the West would flinch and hand over the country, or Russian forces would invade in a lightning campaign, assassinate all the key government officials on day one or two, and frighten the Ukrainians into capitulation with their show of strength. After the West wouldn’t cut a deal, Mr. Putin rolled the dice on a quick win.Well, here we are in the second week of the two-day invasion, and the Ukrainian flag is still flying.There are still several possible outcomes. If Mr. Putin really wants to win—and since he has risked so much already—it’s too much to expect that he will easily back down. The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust, leaving a devastated country and masses of butchered innocents and refugees in his wake. That, now, is the “best” Mr. Putin can hope for.Here is why the most optimistic outcome for Mr. Putin is still bad news for him. For one, the cost will be astronomical. Mr. Biden, arguably, helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war with reckless energy policies that have oil prices rocketing to as much as $130 a barrel. While oil exports can help pay for the Putin war, the cost isn’t cheap. The protracted conflict is burning through Russian cash.The cost of occupying any wasteland Mr. Putin conquered would be higher. At the same time, the value of the Russian currency is crashing, blazing faster than a Russian helicopter shot down by a stinger missile. And sanctions are going to make doing business worldwide much more difficult.After Ukraine, Mr. Putin might want to move on to other targets including lands where Russia is already a threatening influence—in the Balkans, Moldova, and Georgia, or even NATO territory like the Baltic states. At best, though, the Russian military would have to pause and regroup.NATO, for one, would likely be a much more difficult target. Mr. Putin has inadvertently finished President Trump’s work for him. The allies’ rush to beef up defense capabilities—led by, of all countries, Germany—is surely not a scenario Mr. Putin had hoped for. If the momentum continues, Mr. Putin will face a military stalemate.Further, if this crisis propels America and Europe to face the need to come up with responsible policies that deliver affordable, reliable, and abundant energy without relying on Russia, Mr. Putin will lose his two main weapons to intimidate the West: military and energy blackmail. >>> What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWorse, Mr. Putin’s only remaining friend of consequence is China. That’s like saying the only person who has Jason Voorhees’s back is Freddy Krueger. Beijing can’t be happy it’s had to shill for Mr. Putin’s inexcusable war of aggression. That only makes China look like an accomplice. It can’t bail out the enormous backsliding of the Russian economy.As for President Xi’s claim that he was misled by Mr. Putin: nonsense. Sure, China hopes to avoid blow-back from the anger that the free world is heaping on Moscow, but it’s all in for Russia and will do what it can to help. While this all seems bad for Mr. Putin, it could be an even worse winter in Moscow if Ukrainians continue their heroic stand and his forces can’t conquer the country.None of Mr. Putin’s misery should give us joy. His tragedy was born of greater tragedy. Forty-four million Ukrainians were thrown to the wolves because Mr. Biden couldn’t muster a response to Mr. Putin’s threat.The greatest leaders prevent the wars of tyrants by peace through strength. Mr. Biden looks like the fireman who took a day off and let the arsonist run wild.This piece originally appeared in The Sun \n",

            "title:  In a Period of Brute Force, China Increases Its Military Budget Yet Again\n",
            "text The Chinese Communist Party announced this week it will increase the budget for the People’s Liberation Army by 7.1%.The announcement occurred at the opening session of the National People’s Congress—the annual rubber-stamp parliament. Thus, it is just a matter of time before the extra resources start following to the People’s Liberation Army.This increase continues the trend of sustained increases in the Chinese military budget. Since 2018, the Chinese Communist Party has increased the People’s Liberation Army budget by over 28% with consecutive annual increases of between 8.1% and 6.6%.Contrast this with the U.S. defense budget, which grew little under 5% from 2018 to 2021. However, if you take inflation into account, the U.S. defense budget decreased by 3% in those four years.One of the party’s favorite propaganda vehicles, the Global Times, reported that “the proposed defense budget would mark the single-digit growth for seven consecutive years since 2016 and also a return to a 7-plus percent increase.”The return to an above 7% increase comes after successive years of double-digit growth, ranging from 10.7% to 13% in the earlier part of the 2010s. Further, the People’s Liberation Army is able to get more bang for its buck. As just one example, the Chinese labor costs are substantially lower than American labor costs, enabling them to field a bigger force while spending less.Additionally, China can impose its defense costs on its state-owned companies, shielding the People’s Liberation Army budget from these expenses.By any measure, the Chinese Communist Party has been steadily modernizing and investing in its armed forces with the overall goal of having a fully mechanized and informatized military by 2027.This is an assessment shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in its recently released annual threat assessment, which stated that “Beijing is accelerating the development of key capabilities it believes the People’s Liberation Army’s needs to confront the United States in a large-scale, sustained conflict.”The assessment further elaborates that “China will continue pursuing its goal of building a world-class military that will enable it to secure what it views as its sovereign territory, establish its preeminence in regional affairs, and project power globally while offsetting perceived U.S. military superiority.” Clearly the Intelligence Community believes that the Chinese Communist Party has the will to leverage brute force to impose its ideology, as exemplified by its brutal crackdown in Hong Kong.Today we are watching what an undeterred authoritarian power is capable of doing to subjugate its democratic neighbor in Ukraine, as Russian troops destroy cities and target civilian populations indiscriminately.The United States and the world will be paying close attention to the lessons that Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party leadership will derive from the Western response to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. The Chinese Communist Party is investing in building the capabilities it would need to subjugate and dominate its neighbors.One of the lessons to be learned is that dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin are only deterred by the prospect of a strong military response from determined allies. If we hope to deter China from similarly coercing its neighbors, a strong and capable U.S. military will be necessary.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "title:  What’s Driving Up Gas Prices—And Why the White House Won’t Help\n",
            "text When a news anchor confronted Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm about high gasoline prices and asked about the Biden administration’s plan to increase oil production in America, she burst into laughter. “That is hilarious,” she said.It was early November 2021, and gas prices were averaging $3.39 nationally. The reporter wasn’t laughing. And now, with the average price well above $4 and still climbing, no one else is either.Americans feel the pressure build every time they fill up, of course, but it doesn’t stop there. Think of all the activities, goods and services that rely on transportation, and one starts to see how higher gasoline prices increase costs throughout the entire economy.What, many are asking, is going on? And what can be done?>>> Russian Oil Import Ban Just a Distraction From Biden’s Anti-Energy Policies Crude oil prices account for roughly half the price of a gallon of gas, followed by refining costs, distribution, and state and local taxes. Unpacking each shows where policy choices influence the price of gasoline.Start with the last, most straightforward factor first.State and local taxes, most often used to fund transportation infrastructure, explain some significant differences between the price of gasoline between states. While taxes and fees in Nevada average roughly 20 cents per gallon, neighboring California’s tally 50 cents or more because of the state’s punishing climate policies that are designed to discourage people from driving.Distribution—the delivery of gasoline to the customer—is a relatively stable contributor into the price of a gallon. But even here, policy matters. For example, federal law severely restricts the ships available to deliver energy domestically, which actually makes it cheaper for some states to import fuel from Russia than from Texas. This is especially true for coastal states with limited pipeline capacity (yet another policy choice).Then there’s refining, the process that turns oil into usable fuel. Prices increase every summer, when the EPA requires refineries to switch over to more expensive blends of gasoline to comply with Clean Air Act standards. Some states also mandate that refineries make boutique blends of gasoline, forcing customers to pay a green premium. Refinery expenses have also been increasing, as costs to comply with the EPA’s renewable fuel mandate are at record highs.Last, and certainly not least, is crude oil, which provides 90 percent of Americans’ transportation fuel needs. Gasoline prices tend to follow the price of crude oil closely, and everything else being equal, Americans see an increase of 2.4 cents per gallon every time the price of a barrel of crude oil increases by $1. Since oil is a globally traded commodity, the U.S. can’t set the price of oil. But domestic production—and the policies that allow or prevent that from happening—can influence it.The world is now experiencing crude oil prices well over $100 per barrel—prices not seen since 2014. The best way to decrease oil prices—and, given the current context, dilute Russia’s sway in energy markets—is to increase supply. Yet President Joe Biden is unwilling to make the policy changes that would allow this to happen.Biden remains adamant that the solution isn’t to use all the energy resources we have, but to force a transition to a narrow set of politically preferred technologies. So while asking American oil companies for short-term production increases to bail him out of political trouble, Biden has made it clear that he intends to put them out of business in the long term.>>> U.S. Is World’s Largest Oil and Natural Gas Producer—Despite Biden’s Energy-Constraining PoliciesTo that end, the administration’s regulatory agenda aims to choke energy supply. Even now, with Americans struggling, they want to make it more expensive and difficult to explore for and produce oil, construct and operate pipelines, and access financing and investment. And that means they have to manipulate customer demand by discouraging gasoline use in the long run.The only reason American families and businesses are not hurting more than they already are, is because energy production is happening primarily on state and private lands, putting it a little further out of reach of Biden’s anti-energy agenda. For now.In the same month of Granholm’s disastrous interview, White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki was asked whether the administration’s policies contributed to gasoline prices, to which she responded with surprising honesty: “The rise in gas prices over the long term makes an even stronger case for doubling down our investment and our focus on clean energy options.”In other words: High prices are a feature, not a bug, of this administration’s policies.This piece originally appeared in Newsday\n",

            "title:  Saga of Postal “Reform” Bill: Pricey Little Sideshow in 3 Acts\n",
            "text Last week, amid Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine and the rapid passage of a massive 2,741-page, $1.5 trillion spending bill, it’s not surprising that enactment of a postal reform bill (H.R. 3076) got little attention.Touted as a long-awaited “bipartisan” measure, the postal legislation, 15 years in gestation, is anything but noncontroversial.Fast-tracked through Congress, the bill shifts tens of billions of dollars in liabilities from what is supposed to be the “self-financing” U.S. Postal Service to federal taxpayers.If the Postal Service had a company name like “JP Morgan” one could imagine how such a bailout would have drawn immediate opposition from across the political spectrum.   How did such a thing happen? Here’s how this little drama unfolded:Act 1, Scene 1:  House Fast-Tracks Passage  On Feb. 8, with the support of the Biden administration and the powerful postal unions, the House of Representatives passed the Postal Reform Act by a vote of 342 to 92. One might have expected that House Republicans would have at least had second thoughts, but instead, 120 House Republicans joined the Democratic majority.  Act 2, Scene 1: Sen. Scott’s ObjectionThe House bill appeared to be on a smooth glide path to Senate passage. But Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., raised fiscal concerns, requested the Senate take a closer look at the bill, and said he would offer an amendment.So, on Feb. 14, when the bill was brought to the Senate floor for consideration under the Senate’s unanimous consent rule, Scott objected.He did so for good reason: The Postal Service had accumulated tens of billions of dollars in unfunded obligations for postal retiree health costs. (In 2020, the Government Accountability Office estimated those costs at $75 billion.)With the legislative reorganization of Postal Service health care financing, those very real costs do not simply disappear. Instead, the House bill  shifts those costs onto the taxpayer by dumping them onto the financially troubled Medicare program.In explaining his objection, Scott told his colleagues that he simply wanted the Congressional Budget Office to examine the long-term impact of such a major cost shift on the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. And, as Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., noted, there was no Senate hearing on this measure, nor any Senate debate at all.Scott’s objection was reasonable. While the U.S. Postal Service has been bleeding billions of dollars for years, Medicare, the huge federal health program serving senior citizens, is also in serious financial trouble. In four short years, Medicare’s huge hospital program faces insolvency, meaning that, unless Congress acts, Medicare patients face serious benefit payment cuts.Medicare spending is accelerating at warp speed, and it, too, is generating an enormous taxpayer debt in the form of long-term unfunded obligations.Medicare’s trustees estimate the program’s long-term unfunded obligations at $48.3 trillion, the dollar amount of benefits promised, but not financed. That is equivalent to $150,000 per American.More to Scott’s point, with Medicare spending accelerating, piling on billions of dollars of additional unfunded obligations is pouring gasoline on Medicare’s fiscal fires.The House postal bill also imposes a costly mandate on postal retirees. Because the bill forces future postal retirees out of the superior Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) into traditional Medicare for primary coverage, they would now have to buy supplemental coverage, and pay two premiums rather than one, to fill crucial benefit gaps, including catastrophic coverage.This supplemental coverage fuels excess demand and drives up Medicare beneficiary and taxpayer costs even more.Act 2, Scene 2: CBO ReportWhile the CBO did not account for these unfunded obligations in its estimate, or the House bill’s budgetary effects for the next 20 years, as Scott requested, the senator learned from the CBO that the bill would add at least $5 billion to the nation’s deficits.The CBO also dropped a nasty bomblet. It said that, even with enactment of the House bill, it was still “unclear” how the Postal Service would pay for its “ongoing obligations” for health care, including health care for its retirees, after 2031.Act 2, Scene 3: Scott’s AmendmentCongressional bill sponsors simply ignored or downplayed the Medicare cost issue.So, Scott announced a simple amendment: In any transition of postal retirees to full Medicare coverage, the Postal Service should be required to reimburse the Medicare program for any additional costs.If the Medicare cost issue was not a problem, then logically there could be no objection.   The Postal Service, as noted, is supposed to be a self–financing agency. It is, of course, failing as a self-financing agency, running up billions of dollars in annual deficits, and accumulating, according to the GAO, a breathtaking $188 billion (about $580 per person in the U.S.) in debt.That debt includes, of course, its huge unfunded health and pension obligations. In short, the agency is a financial mess.In offering his amendment, Scott asked his Senate colleagues in effect whether America’s taxpayers should be targeted for such a massive cost-shift—a cost-shift that is justified only by the agency’s notorious financial failures.   Act 3, Scene 1: Senate Floor VotesOn March 8, the Senate took up the postal reform bill.Under the prevailing Senate rule, Scott asked for unanimous consent for the Senate to consider and vote on his amendment to require the Postal Service to reimburse the Medicare program for the additional Medicare costs.Johnson, along with Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla.; Mike Braun, R-Ind.;  and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, cosponsored the amendment. Senate Democrats then objected, and blocked consideration of, and a vote on, the Scott amendment.As noted, the CBO confirmed the bill would add to the deficit. So, Scott then made a “point of order” against the bill because it violated the Senate’s budget rules. In response, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,  a socialist, made a motion that the Senate waive the budget rules to advance the House bill. Remarkably, Sanders’ motion passed by a vote of 68 to 30, garnering support from a surprising number of Republican senators.After blocking debate on Scott’s amendment and waiving the budget rules, the Senate passed the House postal bill by a lopsided 79-19 vote.Alas, conscientious lawmakers are often in the minority.    CurtainsThough the postal reform debate is over, at least for now, Scott’s performance was a profile in statesmanship.The senator knows that the bigger and broader Medicare debate is inevitable, and that Medicare’s future financial stability is essential to fulfilling its promise to deliver high-quality care to a large and growing cohort of senior citizens.Medicare reform will soon be among America’s greatest policy challenges.Scott also reminded his colleagues that throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at a problem is not a solution.Bailouts are no substitute for real postal reform, as Heritage analysts have long insisted, and taxpayers’ pockets are not inexhaustible. Maybe next time, they will listen.This piece originally appeared in \n",

            "text Since 2002, the United States Air Force has been on a fitful path to recapitalization of its fleet of air refueling aircraft, which now average 55 years old.REF In an effort to save money, it has reduced its fleet size by retiring aging tankers without suitable replacements. It also has based its future tanker capacity requirements on regional rather than peer-level threats. As it continues to wrestle with a replacement tanker that has experienced considerable delays, the service should:The Air Force began a process to replace its fleet of KC-135 and KC-10 tankers in 2001 with a controversial sole-source proposal that involved both buying and leasing new aircraft from the Boeing Corporation. That program was terminated in 2005 after corruption related to Boeing’s lease proposal was uncovered.REFFollowing that inauspicious start, in 2006, the Air Force issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a highly capable, medium-sized, low-risk, and low-cost tanker to replace the oldest KC-135s in the inventory.REF The two vendors that submitted proposals were the Boeing Corporation and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus at the time, in partnership with Northrup-Grumman. EADS won the contract, but shortly after the award, Boeing filed a formal protest.REF Many in Congress voiced their concerns to the Office of the Secretary of Defense about the award of a major weapons system to a foreign company,REF and in 2008, Secretary Robert Gates terminated the program.REF After a cooling-off period, the Air Force revised the requirements and requested a new set of proposals for its next tanker.The cost of Boeing’s submission in that round of competition reportedly was less than the cost of the EADS submission, and in 2011, the Air Force awarded Boeing a contract to modify its already successful 767 airliner into the KC-46A air refueling platform and deliver a total of 179 tankers in a program that would become known as KC-X.REF The first seven jets were to be delivered in 2015; 18 were to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) by August 2017;REF and the last six were to be acquired in 2027.REFOver the years, the initiative to replace the tanker fleet has morphed into three incremental acquisition programs known as KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z. KC-X acquisition will be completed with the last KC-46A delivery; KC-Y, also known as the Bridge Tanker, was initially intended to replace the KC-10s and a tranche of older KC-135s beginning in 2029; and the KC-Z will replace the remaining KC-135s at some point in the future.REFThe KC-X program has suffered several technical and production challenges, and the Air Force is now on track to accept the last of the KC-46s in 2029 after a three-year delay. To continue the seamless replacement of its aging tankers, the service intends to solicit proposals for KC-Y by the end of 2022 with the intent of receiving the first of as many as 160 tankers in 2029.REFThe KC-46 was designed to refuel both Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps aircraft, and the difference between these two systems are significant.Air Force tanker booms can be configured to fly with a drogue/basket (only) to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, or they can fly with two additional drogue/basket pods mounted on the wings, allowing the tanker to refuel either type of aircraft on the same mission. C-130s can be configured with drogue/basket systems to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, but their offload capacity is much lower because the airframe is smaller and therefore carries less fuel.For the purposes of this paper, C-130s are referred to as tactical air refueling systems, and KC-135, KC-10, KC-46, and KC-Y systems are referred to as strategic air refueling systems/tankers. Before the service begins the selection process for the KC-Y, it is important that the status of the KC-X program and the challenges that have characterized deliveries of the KC-46A be understood.To date, more than 60 KC-46s have been delivered, but even at the most basic level, the program has been marred by a string of system design problems and production faults. The KC-46 design incorporated the concept for a Remote Vision System (RVS) that molds video from multiple cameras at the rear of the plane to create a two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) vision system, allowing the boom operator to sit in the main cabin and refuel the aircraft remotely.During flight testing in 2016 and 2017, aircrew identified several major issues with the RVS and the aircraft’s refueling boom that inhibit the KC-46A from executing its primary mission: refueling other aircraft.REF The jet’s boom was too stiff, which proved to be problematic for fueling lighter aircraft like A-10s and F-16s.REF Problems surrounding the RVS were first reported as issues surrounding a “sunlight glare” during certain times of the day, but the challenge is much deeper.The RVS 2D/3D, black-and-white cameras are mounted at the rear of the KC-46, just behind the aircraft’s boom. While the camera image can wash out during certain sun angles, even when paired with the jet’s 3D goggles, the system does not give boomers the depth perception they need to conduct normal air refueling operations. Stunningly, the system often fails to capture or display the length of the telescopic boom as it extends to make contact with receiver aircraft.REFThe alignment of the RVS cameras in relation to the air refueling boom’s outer tubeREF effectively obscures or masks the last several feet of the telescoping portion of the boom,REF including the refueling probe that makes contact with the refueling receptacles of receiver aircraft.REF If the lighting/sun angle is right, the system can pick up the end of the boom’s shadow on top of the receiving aircraft. This work-around gives boomers the opportunity to gauge the position of the tip of the boom before attempting to connect to receiving aircraft. However, it also assumes the best of conditions, and when viewed in context with current refueling procedures, its associated challenges become glaringly obvious.The refueling receptacle for the F-16 is located several feet behind the cockpit and is not visible to pilots flying those single-seat fighters. Refueling procedures for the F-16 call for the pilots to fly to a position directly in line with the end of the tanker’s boom and then move forward directly toward the end of the probe. As the distance between the end of the boom and the jet’s canopy closes, the boomer uses his depth perception to judge when to move the boom around and then directly behind the F-16’s canopy to make contact with the jet’s refueling receptacle. With questionable depth perception, no reliable ability to see the end of the boom, and no usable surface area in front of the canopy to catch the boom’s shadow, attempting to refuel an F-16 with the KC-46’s RVS system during daytime in clear weather conditions is challenging.In addition, during heavy weather or clear-air turbulence, the tanker and receiver aircraft can move up and down rapidly without warning, often in opposing cycles. Attempting to make a refueling connection without relevant depth perception and without being able to see the end of the boom under those conditions elevates what would otherwise be a benign procedure to one that is mishap-prone, even with the most experienced boomers.While the technical challenges with the boom and RVS are troubling, issues with basic workmanship are equally illuminating. In February 2019, an internal Boeing management memo noted that Air Force pilots were finding so much debris and so many loose tools throughout brand-new jets that “they will not fly [them] due to the FOD (foreign object debris) issues and the current [lack of] confidence they have in our product….”REFBoeing was able to win the KC-X contract primarily because it met three criteria: cost, preservation of the U.S. industrial base for tankers, and previous experience in building the KC-135. While noble in design, all three criteria have delivered poor outcomes for the KC-X acquisition program.Boeing reportedly underbid EADS in a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract that made it financially responsible for cost overruns. To date, the company has absorbed some $5.4 billion in cost overrunsREF that otherwise would have been borne by the government through a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.FFP contracts work well for proven systems or for those with very high technology readiness levels (TRLs), but the design for the KC-46’s RVS system met neither of those criteria. On the surface, Boeing’s FFP contract for the KC-X effectively limited a great deal of financial risk to the government, but it also has caused a significant amount of operational risk. Forcing or even allowing a contractor to insert a low-TRL system under such an agreement can put contractors in dire financial straits, and the collateral effects within this effort have exposed the government to operational risks with enormous attendant costs.Eleven years after the KC-X contract was awarded, the Air Force is accepting aircraft that are years away from having a viable operational capability, and the program remains anything but low risk. The new tanker is prohibited from supporting real-world contingency operations, and the jet’s initial operating capability (IOC) date has slipped to fiscal year (FY) 2024 at the earliest.REF By that time, the Air Force will have taken possession of some 103 KC-46s.REFThe Air Force estimates that the fix for the boom and RVS should be ready by the spring of 2024,REF but the shortcuts the service is taking to make that timeline are eye-opening. The problems with the current system were discovered during flight testing, yet the Air Force has decided not to assess or flight test the fully revised RVS before it accepts the design.REF Problems discovered beyond that point could result in even more significant delays, and the costs for fixing the system will be borne by the Air Force.Assuming the redesign goes as planned, retrofitting jets that the service has already accepted with the boom and RVS redesign will take several years, and the operational impact of that process will be significant: 103 strategic air refueling assets will be unusable in real-world operations in 2024. That number will grow to 110 jets in 2025, equating to 23 percent of the fleet that will be unable to fulfill operational taskings. Assuming that the design and retrofit stay on track, the numbers will slowly start to improve through 2029 when all KC-46s will be fully operational.REFRecognizing the gap in operational capability, Congress, through the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), directed the Air Force to slow or curtail the retirement of viable tanker aircraft until the KC-46 comes up to speed.REF Unfortunately, that move has introduced still other challenges. As the service continues to accept new KC-46s, the squadrons and crews that transition to those jets are no longer available to fly the operationally capable KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The Air Force is studying methods for filling those cockpits and covering the operational gapsREF by hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is retiring. However, while this option may buy down operational risk, it will undoubtedly impose a significant financial burden on the Air Force.Because crews that transition to the KC-46 need to continue training, the service moved last year to meet that need as well as to relieve KC-10 and KC-135 operational tempo where possible. The Air Force approved the KC-46A for stateside operations and refueling missions in support of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM); for aircraft that employ probe/drogue refueling (Navy/Marine Corps fighters); and for 11 Air Force platforms.REF The list does not include the F-35, F-22, or B-2 because of the likelihood of the KC-46 RVS/boom system’s errantly damaging the stealth coatings on those jets. Commanders may elect to waive that restriction during contingency or wartime operations, but they will have to accept the increased operational risk.Boeing is at least seven years away from delivering 179 fully operational KC-46s, and risks to the service and its wartime mission between now and 2029 will be significant. It is important to keep those lessons in mind as the Air Force moves to acquire the next increment of tankers, particularly in light of recent events and the possibility that they might escalate into great-power conflict. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced even the most dovish nations within NATO to revise their defense spending to ready their nations for a possible conflict with Russia,REF and the Commander of Indo-Pacific Command has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that China could move on Taiwan by 2027.REF The potential for great-power conflict is growing, and the United States needs to acquire the capacity to fight such a war.Later this year, the Air Force will release an RFP for the next increment of 150 strategic tankers. Both the Boeing Corporation and Lockheed Martin/Airbus are expected to submit proposals that are designed to capture the KC-Y contract. Boeing is expected to offer the KC-46A that is currently in production in the United States. The Airbus/Lockheed Martin KC-Y proposal, named the Lockheed Martin Next Generation Tanker or LMXT, will be a modified version of Airbus’s A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).The MRTT is already operational and has been certified to refuel every fighter aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and Navy inventories. It has a boom enhanced vision system (BEVS) with 3D, high-definition color displays that allow boomers to sit in the main cabin and remotely refuel other aircraft. BEVS was designed to enable automated air refueling (refueling without a boom operator) using machine vision algorithms. That sub-system is on track to be certified for automatic daytime refueling later in 2022 and nighttime refueling in 2023. Based on the Airbus A-330 airliner, the MRTT design will be modified to increase its fuel capacity.Both the KC-46 and the LMXT have cargoREF and passenger carriage capabilities and are designed to accept high-end command and control equipment to further the Air Battle Management System/Joint Air Domain Command and Control network efforts. However, those capabilities are secondary to the air refueling mission, and the RFP and follow-on acquisition decision process must prioritize those capabilities accordingly.While the overarching tanker acquisition strategy has morphed over the years, the KC-Y Bridge Tanker program was initially designed to replace the KC-10, a jet that can carry significantly more fuel than the KC-135 carries. The distances and fuel offload capacity required to establish a tanker bridge and sustain operations from the United States to the area of operations would be much greater in a peer fight with China than they would be in a fight with Russia. That fact, coupled with China’s intent to target any tanker base within range of its air-to-surface missile systems, makes fuel offload capacity at range a critical capability. The KC-10 carries a maximum of 356,000 pounds of fuel, which is 70 percent more than either the KC-135 or KC-46 can carry, but it burns fuel at a much higher rate than the KC-135, KC46, or LMXT. The KC-135 has a capacity of 200,000 pounds, and the KC-46 can carry 211,000 pounds,REF but the LMXT can carry 268,445 pounds.REFThe operational effects of that additional capacity are not insignificant. In real terms, the LMXT could refuel seven more F-35s than the KC-46 can refuel when the offload point (Air Refueling Contact Point or ARCP) is 1,000 miles from the tanker’s launch and recovery base, six more at an operating radius of 2,000 miles, and five more at 3,000 miles. The LMXT and KC-10 can offload the same amount of fuel at 2,500 miles, but from that point on, because of its more efficient engines, the LMXT can offload more than even the KC-10 is able to offload.REFThe LMXT’s increased capacity and proven track record make it a viable contender in this competition. Because the KC-46 is smaller than the LMXT, it conceivably could operate out of more bases in the Pacific region when both aircraft are loaded to their maximum gross weights. When both aircraft are loaded to the same gross weights, however, the LMXT can fly out of more airfields because of its more powerful engines. Assuming that the issues with its boom and RVS are resolved in due course, the KC-46 will be a serious contender, but it will take years for those issues to be resolved, and acquiring an additional 150 Pegasus platforms before the fix has been accepted would therefore be unwise. Delaying the KC-Y acquisition decision until the KC-46 becomes operational is an option, but such a delay would levy even more risk on an already strained tanker fleet.Pressure from Members of Congress and industrial partners to embrace that risk and fall back on the same cost savings and buy-American criteria that got the service in trouble with the KC-X program will undoubtedly be high. Both sticker price and preservation of an organic American industrial base for tankers are important considerations, but as previously noted, the costs associated with filling the operational gaps created by the KC-46 RVS and boom issues are likewise important. Perhaps as a sign that Airbus/Lockheed Martin learned from their previous proposal, they now have plans to assemble the A-330 airframe in Mobile, Alabama, and modify it into the LMXT tanker in Marietta, Georgia.Finally, the critical technology within the LMXT proposal is already operational and at work in dozens of fielded MRTT platforms, which means the risk associated with acquiring this system would be minimal. The Bridge Tanker acquisition decision is a critical one, and it will be important for the service to go through the acquisition process by the book and avoid the gaffes and resets that it suffered with the KC-X in the mid-2000s. The service needs as many operational booms as it can field for a possible fight with China—even more capacity than it currently is programmed to acquire.By the end of the KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z acquisition programs, the Air Force will have replaced all KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft with new and more capable tankers while reducing the total number of strategic refueling platforms from 479 to 457. That number is woefully insufficient for a peer fight, based on the recent history of real-world operations as well as formal tanker requirement studies.In both 1991 and 2003, the Air Force possessed some 600 KC-135 and KC-10 tankers.REF When the service executed Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, it employed some 271 tankers to support the airbridge to the Persian Gulf as well as combat operations in Iraq.REF Twelve years later, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the demand for Air Force tankers peaked at 319 and then leveled off to a continual demand of 280 (95 airbridge and 185 combat support)—a number that did not include tankers from sister services or allies.REFWith today’s inventory of 479 aircraft, that daily tanker support requirement for a regional war against a Third World adversary would consume 58 percent of our current fleet, and that number does not include combat losses, tankers required to defend the homeland or support deterrence operations in a second theater, or tankers held in reserve to support nuclear strike operations. According to a recent Hudson Institute study, this could mean an additional 325 tankers,REF which, when combined with the sustained Operation Iraqi Freedom requirement of 280 tankers, equates to a capacity requirement of 605 strategic air refueling aircraft.While those numbers are significant, the airbridge and combat support requirements for a peer fight, particularly one conducted in the threat environment and over the vast distances associated with a fight with China, would likely dwarf that number. A U.S. Department of Defense Study completed in 2001 concluded that “500–600 KC-135R equivalents” were needed “to meet the National Military Strategy,” and a 2005 Mobility Capabilities Study “reportedly recommended the acquisition of 520–640 KC-135R model equivalents.”REF Both of those studies were conducted long before the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) directed the services to prepare for great-power competition with China or Russia.REFSeven months after the 2018 NDS was released, the Secretary of the Air Force released “The Air Force We Need,” a study examining the capacity the service would need to support that strategy. Based on thousands of war-game simulations, the study found that the service would need 14 more tanker squadrons than the 40 it had at the time,REF which equates to a total of 691 strategic refueling platforms.REFAlthough the service has backed away from the study because of the associated cost, it remains the most accurate estimate we have for the tanker requirements associated with great-power competition. Other alliances with other nations may bring additional fighter capacity to such a fight, but almost every nation will need the strategic tanker support that only the Air Force can bring.The Air Force should increase its capacity requirement to match the approximately 691 tankers recommended in “The Air Force We Need,” and now is an excellent time to begin. As previously noted, the Air Force is studying methods for covering the operational gaps caused by delays associated with the KC-46. One option would be to shift “retiring” active-duty air refueling assets to the Reserve Component. This would undoubtedly be less expensive than a commercial option, and the assets and crews would have no geographic constraint on where they could fly in times of war.Hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is moving to retire might also be a viable option. While constraints on where those leased platforms could fly would be an issue, the option would allow the service to build the 691-tanker capacity requirement for a peer fight, satisfy congressional concerns, and allow the service to continue or even accelerate its programmed retirements of the KC-10 and KC-135 tanker fleets.REFCongress should:For its part, the Air Force should:The Air Force should move immediately to strengthen the path to recapitalization of its fleet of strategic air refueling aircraft through seamless competition, both to incentivize performance within and to expand the tanker industrial base. The Defense Department should maintain the current proposal and acquisition schedule for the KC-Y, and the award should prioritize proven performance and the minimization of risk. The retirement of viable tanker aircraft fleet should end until operational replacements are in place, and the Air Force should increase its air refueling capacity from 479 to 691 owned or leased tankers to ensure that it is better prepared for possible conflict with a peer competitor.John Venable is Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy in the Center for National Defense, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.\n",

            "title:  What’s Driving Up Gas Prices—And Why the White House Won’t Help\n",
            "text When a news anchor confronted Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm about high gasoline prices and asked about the Biden administration’s plan to increase oil production in America, she burst into laughter. “That is hilarious,” she said.It was early November 2021, and gas prices were averaging $3.39 nationally. The reporter wasn’t laughing. And now, with the average price well above $4 and still climbing, no one else is either.Americans feel the pressure build every time they fill up, of course, but it doesn’t stop there. Think of all the activities, goods and services that rely on transportation, and one starts to see how higher gasoline prices increase costs throughout the entire economy.What, many are asking, is going on? And what can be done?>>> Russian Oil Import Ban Just a Distraction From Biden’s Anti-Energy Policies Crude oil prices account for roughly half the price of a gallon of gas, followed by refining costs, distribution, and state and local taxes. Unpacking each shows where policy choices influence the price of gasoline.Start with the last, most straightforward factor first.State and local taxes, most often used to fund transportation infrastructure, explain some significant differences between the price of gasoline between states. While taxes and fees in Nevada average roughly 20 cents per gallon, neighboring California’s tally 50 cents or more because of the state’s punishing climate policies that are designed to discourage people from driving.Distribution—the delivery of gasoline to the customer—is a relatively stable contributor into the price of a gallon. But even here, policy matters. For example, federal law severely restricts the ships available to deliver energy domestically, which actually makes it cheaper for some states to import fuel from Russia than from Texas. This is especially true for coastal states with limited pipeline capacity (yet another policy choice).Then there’s refining, the process that turns oil into usable fuel. Prices increase every summer, when the EPA requires refineries to switch over to more expensive blends of gasoline to comply with Clean Air Act standards. Some states also mandate that refineries make boutique blends of gasoline, forcing customers to pay a green premium. Refinery expenses have also been increasing, as costs to comply with the EPA’s renewable fuel mandate are at record highs.Last, and certainly not least, is crude oil, which provides 90 percent of Americans’ transportation fuel needs. Gasoline prices tend to follow the price of crude oil closely, and everything else being equal, Americans see an increase of 2.4 cents per gallon every time the price of a barrel of crude oil increases by $1. Since oil is a globally traded commodity, the U.S. can’t set the price of oil. But domestic production—and the policies that allow or prevent that from happening—can influence it.The world is now experiencing crude oil prices well over $100 per barrel—prices not seen since 2014. The best way to decrease oil prices—and, given the current context, dilute Russia’s sway in energy markets—is to increase supply. Yet President Joe Biden is unwilling to make the policy changes that would allow this to happen.Biden remains adamant that the solution isn’t to use all the energy resources we have, but to force a transition to a narrow set of politically preferred technologies. So while asking American oil companies for short-term production increases to bail him out of political trouble, Biden has made it clear that he intends to put them out of business in the long term.>>> U.S. Is World’s Largest Oil and Natural Gas Producer—Despite Biden’s Energy-Constraining PoliciesTo that end, the administration’s regulatory agenda aims to choke energy supply. Even now, with Americans struggling, they want to make it more expensive and difficult to explore for and produce oil, construct and operate pipelines, and access financing and investment. And that means they have to manipulate customer demand by discouraging gasoline use in the long run.The only reason American families and businesses are not hurting more than they already are, is because energy production is happening primarily on state and private lands, putting it a little further out of reach of Biden’s anti-energy agenda. For now.In the same month of Granholm’s disastrous interview, White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki was asked whether the administration’s policies contributed to gasoline prices, to which she responded with surprising honesty: “The rise in gas prices over the long term makes an even stronger case for doubling down our investment and our focus on clean energy options.”In other words: High prices are a feature, not a bug, of this administration’s policies.This piece originally appeared in Newsday\n",

            "text In the latest in a series of specious and outlandish justifications for its illegal, immoral, and brutal invasion of sovereign Ukraine, Russia is claiming that Washington and Kyiv are working together to develop chemical and biological weapons.Pure Putin propaganda.Indeed, according to the U.S. State Department this week:The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.On the other hand, the State Department notes:It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.No surprises in that State Department claim, considering that Russian operatives have used the Novichok nerve agent to attack former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and Russian political dissident Alexei Navalny in recent years.Russia has also shamelessly supported the regime of Syria’s Bashar Assad, which has used a variety of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in the brutal civil war there. With the war in Ukraine in a stalemate that includes significant losses for the Russian forces in the face of stiff Ukrainian political and military resistance, Russia is looking for ways to reenergize its political and military campaign to subjugate Ukraine.To do this, Moscow might develop a “false flag” operation, involving the use of chemical (or less likely biological) weapons in Ukraine against Russian forces, ethnic Russians in Ukraine, or even Ukrainian civilians.The attack could possibly be choreographed to look like it was supposedly executed by Ukrainian forces.An even more elaborate Russian operation might try to finger U.S. or NATO forces, rather than Ukrainian forces, as being the perpetrators of such a heinous act, which would almost assuredly include examples of those supposedly killed by the weapons.Such a contrived act would likely take place on Ukrainian territory currently controlled by Russian forces, such as the eastern Ukrainian region of the Donbas. The false flag operation could be used to “change the channel” on Russian brutality in Ukraine in the international information space. Indeed, the Chinese are reportedly parroting this Russian propaganda about weapons labs. A false flag operation could also be used to burnish the image of the Russian armed forces at home, where the Russian people are being fed a steady diet of propaganda about the Ukraine invasion.Even more troubling, the false flag operation could be used to justify an escalation in the use of force and violence in Ukraine.Based on Biden administration statements, likely supported by U.S. and other intelligence, the Kremlin would use any trick in the book to justify its unjustifiable war in Ukraine—including the use of weapons of mass destruction.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "title:  What’s Driving Up Gas Prices—And Why the White House Won’t Help\n",
            "text When a news anchor confronted Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm about high gasoline prices and asked about the Biden administration’s plan to increase oil production in America, she burst into laughter. “That is hilarious,” she said.It was early November 2021, and gas prices were averaging $3.39 nationally. The reporter wasn’t laughing. And now, with the average price well above $4 and still climbing, no one else is either.Americans feel the pressure build every time they fill up, of course, but it doesn’t stop there. Think of all the activities, goods and services that rely on transportation, and one starts to see how higher gasoline prices increase costs throughout the entire economy.What, many are asking, is going on? And what can be done?>>> Russian Oil Import Ban Just a Distraction From Biden’s Anti-Energy Policies Crude oil prices account for roughly half the price of a gallon of gas, followed by refining costs, distribution, and state and local taxes. Unpacking each shows where policy choices influence the price of gasoline.Start with the last, most straightforward factor first.State and local taxes, most often used to fund transportation infrastructure, explain some significant differences between the price of gasoline between states. While taxes and fees in Nevada average roughly 20 cents per gallon, neighboring California’s tally 50 cents or more because of the state’s punishing climate policies that are designed to discourage people from driving.Distribution—the delivery of gasoline to the customer—is a relatively stable contributor into the price of a gallon. But even here, policy matters. For example, federal law severely restricts the ships available to deliver energy domestically, which actually makes it cheaper for some states to import fuel from Russia than from Texas. This is especially true for coastal states with limited pipeline capacity (yet another policy choice).Then there’s refining, the process that turns oil into usable fuel. Prices increase every summer, when the EPA requires refineries to switch over to more expensive blends of gasoline to comply with Clean Air Act standards. Some states also mandate that refineries make boutique blends of gasoline, forcing customers to pay a green premium. Refinery expenses have also been increasing, as costs to comply with the EPA’s renewable fuel mandate are at record highs.Last, and certainly not least, is crude oil, which provides 90 percent of Americans’ transportation fuel needs. Gasoline prices tend to follow the price of crude oil closely, and everything else being equal, Americans see an increase of 2.4 cents per gallon every time the price of a barrel of crude oil increases by $1. Since oil is a globally traded commodity, the U.S. can’t set the price of oil. But domestic production—and the policies that allow or prevent that from happening—can influence it.The world is now experiencing crude oil prices well over $100 per barrel—prices not seen since 2014. The best way to decrease oil prices—and, given the current context, dilute Russia’s sway in energy markets—is to increase supply. Yet President Joe Biden is unwilling to make the policy changes that would allow this to happen.Biden remains adamant that the solution isn’t to use all the energy resources we have, but to force a transition to a narrow set of politically preferred technologies. So while asking American oil companies for short-term production increases to bail him out of political trouble, Biden has made it clear that he intends to put them out of business in the long term.>>> U.S. Is World’s Largest Oil and Natural Gas Producer—Despite Biden’s Energy-Constraining PoliciesTo that end, the administration’s regulatory agenda aims to choke energy supply. Even now, with Americans struggling, they want to make it more expensive and difficult to explore for and produce oil, construct and operate pipelines, and access financing and investment. And that means they have to manipulate customer demand by discouraging gasoline use in the long run.The only reason American families and businesses are not hurting more than they already are, is because energy production is happening primarily on state and private lands, putting it a little further out of reach of Biden’s anti-energy agenda. For now.In the same month of Granholm’s disastrous interview, White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki was asked whether the administration’s policies contributed to gasoline prices, to which she responded with surprising honesty: “The rise in gas prices over the long term makes an even stronger case for doubling down our investment and our focus on clean energy options.”In other words: High prices are a feature, not a bug, of this administration’s policies.This piece originally appeared in Newsday\n",

            "title:  The Russian Threat: Bolstering NATO Deterrence at a Critical Time\n",
            "text The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including the United States, rests on the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Russia’s ongoing war of naked aggression against Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which threat should be the focus of NATO’s upcoming strategic concept.The answer is clear: The U.S. must lead the Alliance to a wholesale refocusing on the organization’s raison d’être of collective defense. While the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the fact remains that Russia continues to be the only existential threat to member states. NATO must send a strong signal that it is strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to the increased threat from Russia.Deterrence measures should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of Russia’s position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground, and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued commitment to the NATO treaty’s Article 5.These deterrence measures must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S. must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture must not be to the detriment of the nation’s ability to counter China.From the Arctic to the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable threat to NATO and the interests of its members. For member states in Eastern Europe, Russia represents a real and potentially existential threat. Russia’s entrenched position in Belarus, along with its ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members, in two, scramble the geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern flank.Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine will hopefully be the push that some allies need to finally live up to their commitments to the NATO defense spending benchmark. As an intergovernmental security alliance, NATO is only as strong as its member states. Weak defense spending on the continent has led to a significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing gaps in readiness for NATO allies. As a result, American Presidents of both political parties have long called for increases in defense spending by NATO allies.Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—an attack on one is an attack on all—Article 3 is the most important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3 states that member states, at a minimum, will “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.” Only a handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to their Article 3 commitment.In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense investment, NATO set a target for its 30 member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales Summit, member states recommitted to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and committed to spending 20 percent of their defense budgets on “major equipment” purchases by 2024.NATO allies have made real and sustained increases in defense spending in recent years, but it is far from enough. In 2021, 10 members of the Alliance spent 2 percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20 percent benchmark.REF Procuring capabilities does not happen overnight, and allies in NATO must commit today to investing the necessary political and economic capital to fulfill their Article 3 treaty commitments.U.S. basing structures in Europe harken back to a time when Denmark, West Germany, and Greece represented the front lines of freedom. The security situation in Europe has changed, not least of which due to Russia’s force posture in Belarus and occupied portions of Ukraine. The U.S. must account for this shift by establishing a persistent and continuing military presence in allied nations further east. A robust presence displays the long-term U.S. resolve to live up to its NATO treaty commitments. The U.S. should lead by example, while also encouraging other NATO allies to base forces in Eastern European member states.Over the course of the past few weeks, the U.S. has deployed additional rotational forces in Europe. On Thursday, 7,000 troops from the Army’s First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, deployed to bases in Germany.REF In total, the U.S. has deployed an additional 14,000 troops to Europe in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has also redeployed aircraft further east on a temporary basis, including 20 Apache helicopters (AH-64s) based in Germany deploying to Baltic allies, 12 AH-64s based in Greece deploying to Poland,REF and six F-35 fighter jets from Utah deploying temporarily to bases in Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania.REF Furthermore, two B-52s from the 5th Bomb Wing deployed on a “long-planned Bomber Task Force Europe mission over the Arctic and Baltic Sea regions.”REFEarlier in February, the U.S. deployed 3,000 forces to Poland and Romania to bolster deterrence and aid in preparations for refugees crossing the border from Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that “[t]hese moves are temporary in nature, and are part of the more than 90,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent orders.”Some NATO allies have also increased their presence further east. Germany, which serves as the framework nation in Lithuania for NATO’s enhanced forward presence battalion stationed there, added 350 troops.REF NATO allies have battlegroups stationed in Estonia (U.K.-led), Latvia (Canadian-led), and Poland (U.S.-led); France has offered to lead a similar battalion in Romania, and stated that it is “accelerating” the deployment of forces to the nation.REF On Friday, NATO activated its Very High Readiness Joint Taskforce (VJTF), with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: “We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense.”REF NATO will partially deploy a portion of the VJTF to Eastern Europe; the deployment will include air, land, and naval assets.REFRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine highlights the stark reality that the threat from Russia to NATO is real and enduring. The U.S. and its allies must take immediate steps to bolster collective defense and deter Vladimir Putin from aggression against a NATO member state. In light of the emerging new security reality on the continent, the U.S. should:Russia’s ongoing violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine highlights the importance of NATO and its Article 5 guarantee, as well as the need for a united and robust Alliance posture in Eastern Europe. Both are necessary for sending a clear message to Russia to deter Putin from violating the sovereignty of a NATO member.Daniel Kochis is Senior Policy Analyst in European Affairs in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.

            "text Georgia parents, unhappy that their children are being used as cannon fodder in the culture wars, have demanded action from their political leaders.This is the impetus for bills currently before the Georgia legislature. They are a direct response to parents who have demonstrated through survey data and elections that they reject radical ideas.Too many public schools have largely given up on the teaching of logic, civics, rhetoric, philosophy or classical languages—the subjects that previously turned schoolchildren into educated Americans. Instead, many schools are now focused on indoctrinating their wards with radical ideologies that seek to undermine the foundation of the United States by returning to the regressive idea that we must separate people by race, which activists insist is somehow progressive.These lessons are inspired by an ideology called critical race theory. CRT is a body of work whose main tenets are that racism in America is systemic, that our society is oppressive, that white people selfishly accept change only when it benefits them, that racial identity is paramount, that government must pursue race-conscious policies in violation of the Constitution, that individualism is suspect, and that enlightenment principles wrongly universalize white people.Critics of anti-CRT efforts always misleadingly insist—and they are saying the same thing with respect to the Georgia bills—that “CRT is not being taught in K-12 schools.” This is not the slam-dunk they imagine.Of course, long tracts by CRT architects such as Derrick Bell, Kimberle Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, Charles Lawrence or Neil Gotanda are not being handed out in third grade classes. But children are getting messages that race defines and limits them. On social media, Tarece Johnson, the Gwinnett County school board chair, said white people are “socialized racists” while black people have “internalized racism.”CRT teaches that one must see racism everywhere, even in “the ordinary business of society,” as one of its founders, Richard Delgado, has written. “Transformative change” is key. According to its founders, CRT is, above all, a tool for revolution. As Derrick Bell wrote, “As I see it, critical race theory recognizes that revolutionizing a culture begins with the radical assessment of it.”Those who will use our children in the front line of this cultural revolution have a very low view of their fellow Georgians. In a recent guest column in this education blog, professors T. Jameson Brewer and Brandon Haas spoke of the anti-CRT movement as “an effort to satiate the public’s broad ignorance about buzzwords such as critical race theory.”Georgians are not being ignorant. They are rejecting prejudice and standing up for their children. The same cannot be said of the activists seeking to use schools and students to further their discriminatory ideological agenda.This piece originally appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n",

            "title:  The Biden Administration’s Radical Regulatory Agenda\n",
            "text The Biden Administration’s regulatory agenda for 2022 reveals complete indifference toward the social and economic chaos perpetrated to date by the President’s progressive policies. Few, if any, of the thousands of looming regulations are necessary or beneficial notwithstanding the enormous costs, and many will erode free enterprise and individual liberty.Publication of this semiannual “Unified Agenda”REF is required by Executive Order 12866REF to provide public notice of rulemakings. Fall editions of the agenda are accompanied by agency statements of regulatory priorities, known collectively as the “Regulatory Plan.”REFIn its introduction to the latest plan, released on December 10, 2021, the White House boasts that federal agencies will “build on significant progress the Administration has already made advancing our priorities and proving that our Government can deliver results—from confronting the pandemic, to creating a stronger and fairer economy, to addressing climate change and advancing equity.”REFAs with so much of the Leftist manifesto, this conceit about government’s efficacy and beneficence is misguided. In actuality, the Biden Administration has failed to check the spread of the coronavirus.REF Its unconstrained spending has contributed to the worst inflation in 40 years, while 18 months of welfare and unemployment profligacy has intensified an unprecedented labor shortage and supply chain crisis.REF There are also billions of dollars being funneled into destructive climate initiatives that actually undermine rather than enhance environmental quality. The Administration’s preoccupation with racial and gender equity is also exacerbating what Heritage Foundation scholar Mike Gonzalez has dubbed America’s “grievance caste system,”REF thereby sowing discord and resentment.For the Biden Administration to assert that more regulation and even bigger government will “improve the lives of the American people” mocks the challenges facing the nation and betrays the fundamental principles of its Founding. Now more than ever, citizens must demand that Congress reclaim its oversight responsibilities and lawmaking authority and codify rigorous rulemaking standards. Otherwise, the Biden Administration’s radical regulatory agenda will reduce America to “nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.”REFThe new Biden agenda lists 2,678 “active”REF regulatory actions, which exceeds by 35 percent the number of prospective rulemakings in the first fall agenda issued by the Trump Administration. It also signals a return to the regulatory excesses of the Obama years, when the private-sector regulatory burden increased by an astonishing $122 billion annually.REF  Among the active rulemakings (proposed and final) in the Biden agenda, there are 200 designated as “economically significant”—i.e., regulations that are each expected to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There is no determination of economic impact for an additional 449 rulemakings, which reveals how inconsequential regulatory costs are to the White House and the executive branch bureaucracy.The economically significant rules in the agenda include:This deluge of economically significant rules easily surpasses the volume and scope of those proposed by his predecessors in their initial fall agendas.  The Biden agenda is also marked by encroachment on state and local affairs, including how Americans fuel our cars and heat our homes, educate our children, zone our communities, and construct our roads—among myriad others. Indeed, at least 30 agenda actions are designated as inflicting “substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.”REFImbalance in the federal–state relationship has profound effects on self-government. The U.S. Constitution unequivocally limits federal authority in order to impede the consolidation of power and to maximize political accountability, policy innovation, and civic participation. To the extent that Washington violates constitutional strictures and usurps states’ authority, the functions of federalism are thwarted.Such excessive federal interference inhibits policy competition among states and subordinates the relative transparency and accountability of state- and local-level regulation. It also impedes the ability of both citizens and businesses to escape flawed policies by crossing state borders.REFAgenda actions with federalism effects include:The actual extent of the President’s power grab is much greater, of course, but there has been no determination of the effects on federalism for 228 other regulatory actions in the latest agenda.None of the 454 agencies listed in the Federal Register tracks regulatory costs either cumulatively or in the aggregate. The most widely cited estimate pegs the annual cost of compliance for the private sector to be $2 trillion,REF which roughly equals the amount of individual and corporate taxes collected by the federal government.Just the paperwork burden of red tape currently totals 10.6 billion hours annually at an estimated cost of $145.2 billion.REFThe cost to taxpayers of administering all the red tape is massive, totaling nearly $80 billion annually (based on fiscal year 2021 budget figures), which is up from $25 billion in 2000.REF A large part of the increase is the swelling legions of regulators—who now number an all-time high of 2.2 million.REF  Another measure of the unbridled regulatory output: The Code of Federal Regulations has increased in volume by 35 percent since 2000—and 239 percent during the past five decades—from 54,834 pages to 185,984 pages.REF  Regulatory zealots such as President Biden attempt to justify their rulemaking by focusing on the benefits. But those come with enormous costs. Indeed, 40 years of command-and-control regulatory schemes have led to massive, ineffective, and unaccountable bureaucracies and a raft of costly unintended consequences.Regulations also shift labor and capital away from productive activities, such as innovation and job creation, to compliance activities. The burden falls heaviest on new businesses, which inhibits job creation, undermines competition, and secures the dominance of incumbent firms. Unsustainable compliance costs also drive mergers, further consolidating markets.The Biden agenda is brimming with regulations to expand the existing web of global warming dictates. Of course, none will have any effect on climate,REF but all will advance the progressive goal of consolidating government control over the exploration, generation, transmission, and use of energy. Not only is this rulemaking frenzy a colossal waste of time and money, it is an affront to the will of Congress, which for years has declined to enact global warming measures.The latest agenda includes more than 100 regulations governing the design and functioning of appliances, including refrigerators and freezers (residential, commercial, and industrial); clothes washers and dryers; furnaces and boilers; ceiling fans; pool pumps and heaters; air compressors; light bulbs; water heaters; dishwashers; battery chargers; televisions; ice makers; air conditioners; dehumidifiers; electric motors; pre-rinse spray valves; and air cleaners.The Department of Energy is also weakening the evidentiary standards and administrative obligations for imposing more stringent energy restrictions. The department’s actions are a direct result of President Biden’s Executive Order 13990, which pledges the Administration’s commitment—without a hint of irony—to “be guided by the best science and be protected by processes that ensure the integrity of Federal decision-making.”REFThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) agenda includes finalizing yet another round of emissions restrictions for passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The new standard is expressed as the equivalent to a fuel efficiency of 55 miles per gallon of gasoline, which represents emissions reductions of 5 percent to 10 percent between 2023 and 2026.REF This represents a dramatic—if unattainable—tightening of the standard compared to the Trump Administration’s proposed reductions of about 1.5 percent per year.Meeting such a drastic reduction target cannot be accomplished without revving up production of electric vehicles—heavily subsidized by taxpayers—as well as a heaping serving of political largesse (in the form of exemptions and credits). The EPA claims that the new standards will add $1,000 to the price of a 2026 model year vehicle.REF But that lowball estimate fails to account for the slew of highway injuries and fatalities that result from vehicle downsizing.REFNew standards for trucks are also in the works, as are stricter passenger vehicle standards for model year 2027 and beyond.EPA Administrator Michael Regan claims that the new emissions standards will be “underpinned by sound science and technical expertise.”REF That is not even remotely true. The potential effects of so-called greenhouse gas emissions are inherently speculative: The science is far from settled about the volume of greenhouse gas emissions—if any—that would provoke changes in climate.REFThe White House is also planning a broad regulatory crackdown on new and existing sources of oil and natural gas, as well as fossil-fuel-fired power plants—all of which would push up already skyrocketing energy prices. Indeed, energy prices have been a major contributor to recent inflation, jumping nearly 30 percent overall in 2021. Gasoline prices were up 49.6 percent and natural gas rose 24 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.REFApparently not satisfied with encumbering the transportation and energy sectors, the White House is also preparing to regulate the financial sector to (supposedly) mitigate “climate-related risks.” For example, the agenda includes a proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission to force issuers of public securities (stocks and bonds) to report on the risks that climate change poses to their investments.As noted by Heritage expert David Burton, such disclosures would rely on “purely speculative highly divergent and uncertain climate modeling” and thus “would obfuscate rather than inform” and “harm rather than benefit investors.”REFMost recently, President Biden’s nominee for the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision, Sarah Bloom Raskin, has openly advocated using the power of the Fed to limit oil and gas companies’ access to credit.REF Not only would this violate the Fed’s prescribed role, it would also undermine the stability and security of the nation’s energy supplies.REFOn his first day in office, President Biden dedicated his Administration to an “ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda.”REF He thus directed agencies to assess whether “underserved communities and their members face systemic barriers in accessing benefits and opportunities” under federal policies and programs.As detailed in the unified agenda, the pursuit of equity in regulation is both senseless and alarming, including:On a broader scale, the Biden Administration is using “equity” in the analysis of regulatory effects in order to create a moral imperative for ever-greater government power. In his memorandum on regulatory review, for example, the President instructed the Office of Management and Budget to “propose procedures that take into account the distributional consequences of regulations…to ensure that regulatory initiatives appropriately benefit and do not inappropriately burden disadvantaged, vulnerable, marginalized communities.”REFA thorough cost–benefit analysis would typically identify regulatory targets and beneficiaries; costs and benefits could not otherwise be accurately calculated. The analyses largely focus on “direct” costs, which is insufficient for gauging the ripple effects of regulation across the economy. But President Biden’s demand for regulatory “equity” is not a methodological technique; it is a political calculation that could serve as justification for virtually any regulatory action.If President Biden really is intent on reducing the “distributional consequences of regulations,” he would prioritize deregulation over red tape. The burden of regulation inexorably falls heaviest on low-income families and fixed-income seniors because the costs translate to higher consumer prices that exhaust a relatively larger share of their household budgets.The Biden Administration’s unified agenda is heavily focused on rescinding a host of regulatory restraints instituted by President Donald Trump. According to the regulatory tracker compiled by the Brookings Center on Regulation and Markets, President Biden has revoked 44 executive orders signed by President Trump.REF Also gone is the designation of “deregulatory” in the agenda—which (evidently) is of no use to the current Administration.The Trump Administration, in its first six months, launched a multifaceted reform agenda that dramatically reversed the unparalleled regulatory expansion of the Obama Administration. For example, to reset agencies’ regulatory orientation, President Trump directed regulators to identify for elimination at least two prior regulations for every one new regulation issued and to control regulatory costs through a budgeting process.The volume of new regulations dramatically slowed during the Trump years, with the Administration issuing 74.9 percent fewer “significant” regulations than did the Obama Administration (within the same period) and 66.6 percent fewer than the Bush Administration.That regulatory restraint is widely credited as contributing to robust growth in gross domestic product, record low unemployment, and a long-running stock market surge. Alas, President Biden, on Day One, revoked many of the Trump reforms, and the Administration’s latest unified agenda targets dozens of others for repeal, including the following:The goal of reform is not to arbitrarily reduce the number of rules but instead to (1) ensure that each regulation is necessary and effective; (2) respects the constitutional limits on government power; and (3) hold policymakers accountable for the impacts. To advance these goals, Congress should:President Biden’s regulatory agenda represents a massive tax on all Americans and the entire U.S. economy: higher energy rates resulting from dubious global warming schemes, increased food prices from excessive production standards, restricted access to credit under reams of paternalistic dictates, and fewer health care choices and higher costs from a raft of medical mandates, to name a few. This is not the limited government of America’s Founding, its constitutional framework, or its republican ideals. Unless constrained, the Biden Administration will crush the freedoms on which this nation was founded.Diane Katz is Senior Research Fellow in Regulatory Policy in the Thomas A.

            "title:  A Look at Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Most Noteworthy Judicial Decisions\n",
            "text On March 21, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing will begin. Senators will be scrutinizing her past judicial opinions on critical issues from labor law to illegal immigration to presidential claims of executive privilege. This brief overview of several of those key opinions provides some insight into her general approach to resolving legal issues.Jackson has been through this confirmation process three times before—when she was nominated to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, to the district court, and to the D.C. Circuit—but it is safe to say that a lot more people are going to be paying attention this time.The first day will be taken up with speeches by all the senators of the Senate Judiciary Committee and will conclude with an opening statement by the nominee herself.The real fireworks, though, will take place over the next two days when senators ask a battery of questions of the nominee herself, many of which she will avoid answering, citing the longstanding rule that a nominee should not answer questions about legal issues that might come before the Supreme Court if she is confirmed.In fairness, this tactic, which has come to be known as the “Ginsburg rule,” has been used by Supreme Court nominees under both Democratic and Republican presidents and by nominees that long predated the nomination of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.During her confirmation hearing, for example, Justice Amy Coney Barrett invoked the woman she replaced when she said, “Justice Ginsburg with her characteristic pithiness used to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing. No hints, no previews, no forecasts. That had been the practice of nominees before her. But everybody calls it the Ginsburg rule because she stated it so concisely.”One area that she will be asked to address is her judicial philosophy. During her confirmation hearing to the D.C. Circuit last year, Jackson indicated that she does not have a “judicial philosophy per se,” a surprising answer for someone who clerked for three judges, including a Supreme Court justice and who had been a federal judge for eight years.In response to written questions from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who pressed her on the issue, Jackson wrote that as a lower court judge, she was not at liberty “to interpret the text of the Constitution in any manner other than as the Supreme Court has directed.”She added that, as a sitting judge, she has an ethical obligation “to avoid commenting on, or providing personal views of, disputed legal matters such as the most appropriate method of interpreting the Constitution.”This bob-and-weave answer should not cut it. As I have written elsewhere:It is individual justices, not the high court as a whole, who adopt the ‘methodology’ that they think is most appropriate when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. Moreover, she will be free from any constraints she might otherwise have felt as a lower court judge if she is elevated to the Supreme Court.Furthermore, it is one thing not to comment on a legal issue that may come before the court for resolution in the future, but the “most appropriate method of interpreting the Constitution” is not one of them.Judges and justices have written books and given speeches providing their views on that very subject many, many times, and Jackson should provide a direct and nonevasive answer to that question. We’ll see whether she sticks with her previous answer and how it will fly if she does.Another area that will clearly not be off limits, though, and where it will be harder for Jackson to duck and weave, is answering questions about past opinions that she has written as a judge. And since she has written close to 600 of them over the course of her eight years as a district court judge and roughly six months as an appellate judge, there will be much to talk about.Trump CasesJackson was involved in two cases that impacted former President Donald Trump directly, and which buoyed her supporters.In Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn, the House Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit seeking to compel testimony by former White House counsel Don McGahn in connection with the committee’s investigation into potential foreign interference during the 2016 election.In granting the committee’s motion for summary judgment, Jackson held that the committee had standing to file the suit and that the case was justiciable, or appropriate for a court to decide, even though it involved a dispute between two branches of government.In so holding, she wrote: “Simply put, the primary takeaway from 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings. … This means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control.”She added:Today, this Court adds that this conclusion is inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law. That is to say, however busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires.The Department of Justice had not argued that Trump was a king or above the law. These phrases, though, were frequently invoked by liberal politicians and pundits at the time to caricature the president (see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here), and it is troubling that Jackson chose to parrot this unnecessarily inflammatory rhetoric.A three-judge D.C. Circuit panel reversed Jackson on the issues of standing and justiciability, but the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc (all active judges of the circuit, not just the panel, presided) reversed the original panel on the first issue, and the case settled before the en banc court resolved the second issue.As an appellate judge, Jackson recently joined an opinion written by Judge Patricia Millett in Trump v. Thompson upholding a lower court decision rejecting Trump’s effort to block the release of documents being held by the National Archives to the Jan. 6 committee after the Biden administration declined to assert executive privilege to block their release. The Supreme Court refused to intervene, with only Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting.Labor Law CasesJackson has issued several significant opinions in labor law cases that likely go a long way in explaining why liberal groups like Demand Justice designated her as their preferred nominee. She is clearly partial to labor unions and is highly skeptical, if not downright hostile, to any attempt to limit their ability to unionize or engage in collective bargaining.In Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Trump, Jackson ruled in favor of federal labor unions challenging three of Trump’s executive orders related to collective bargaining rights. The executive orders limited the issues unions could bargain over, the amount of time labor union officials could spend with union members, and the rights of members to appeal disciplinary actions.Jackson concluded that those orders conflicted with the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. A unanimous D.C. Circuit panel reversed her decision, holding that Jackson did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and that such claims had to be pursued through the administrative process established under the Federal Labor Relations Act.In a pair of written opinions in AFL-CIO v. NLRB, Jackson vacated (invalidated) a National Labor Relations Board rule that amended union election procedures to slow down the union election process. She concluded that the rule contained more than procedural rule changes and should have been subject to notice-and-comments rulemaking requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act.In AFL-CIO v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, a group of public sector unions challenged a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that raised the threshold for management-initiated changes to employment conditions that would trigger collective bargaining rights.In her first written majority opinion as a judge on the D.C. Circuit, Jackson invalidated the rule, which raised the threshold from changes that had de minimis effect on a condition of employment to changes that had a substantial impact on a condition of employment, concluding the authority’s decision was insufficiently reasoned and, therefore, arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.Professor Jonathan Adler of the Case Western Reserve University School of Law described this opinion as “an erroneous and unduly strict application” of applicable Supreme Court precedent.Immigration CasesThere is at least one high-profile case in which Jackson appeared to stretch the law—and was overturned—to frustrate the Trump administration’s efforts to rigorously enforce our nation’s immigration laws.In Make the Road N.Y. v. McAleenan, immigration advocacy groups brought a pre-enforcement challenge to the Department of Homeland Security secretary’s decision to expand the categories of noncitizens that would be subject to expedited removal from the United States.Jackson entered a nationwide preliminary injunction to prevent the revised rule from taking effect, concluding that she had jurisdiction to consider the case and that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the agency’s action was arbitrary and capricious and therefore violated the Administrative Procedure Act.In doing so, she wrote that the government’s argument was “peculiar” and “reeks of bad faith, demonstrates contempt for the authority that the Constitution’s Framers have vested in the judicial branch, and, ultimately, deprives successful plaintiffs of the full measure of the remedy to which they are entitled.”The D.C. Circuit reversed her injunction. The majority opinion, written by fellow Obama appointee Millett, held that while the district court had jurisdiction to consider the matter, Congress had granted the secretary “sole and unreviewable discretion” on expedited removal determinations.Judge Neomi Rao dissented, arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the Immigration and Nationality Act bars judicial review of the secretary’s discretionary decisions about expedited removal.In Kiakombua v. Wolf, Jackson ruled in favor of five noncitizens who were subject to expedited removal and against the Trump administration and held that changes made by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security, to its Credible Fear Lesson Plan utilized criteria that had not been prescribed by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Jackson vacated the revised rule and ordered that the plaintiffs be provided with a new asylum hearing using lawful standards.In Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan, environmental groups challenged the homeland security secretary’s invocation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act to waive certain environmental laws in order to expedite construction of a border wall in New Mexico.In contrast to her decision in Make the Road, Jackson granted the government’s motion to dismiss the case, concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction under the relevant statute to consider nonconstitutional challenges to such a decision. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Wolf was another case in which Jackson sided with the government. In that case, several advocacy groups challenged the government’s policy of holding noncitizens in Customs and Border Protection facilities, which they claimed were inhumane, while awaiting asylum interviews.Jackson held that while the plaintiffs had standing to bring the case, the detention policy was a reasonable interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its implementing regulations.Other Important Administrative CasesIn Policy and Research v. HHS and a companion case, Jackson ruled that Department of Health and Human Services’ announcement that it was going to shorten the time period for grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs from five years to three years was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act because it was issued without notice or an adequate explanation.But some of Jackson’s decisions—even those ruling against an agency—cannot be characterized as reflexively liberal.For example, in Otay Mesa Property, L.P. v. Dep’t of Interior, while agreeing that the Endangered Species Act would allow the Interior Department to protect fairy shrimp in vernal pools that were “occupied” by them, Jackson agreed with the plaintiff that the agency’s designation of the land and water between the pools—a total of 56 acres—as critical habitat for the species was “manifestly unreasonable.”Racial PreferencesIn Rothe Dev., Inc. v. Dep’t of Def., Jackson rejected the plaintiff’s constitutional challenge to Section 8(a) of the Small Business Administration Act, which establishes a program of preferential treatment in government contracting for businesses owned by “socially disadvantaged individuals,” concluding that the program satisfied strict scrutiny.The D.C. Circuit (over a partial dissent) affirmed her judgment, albeit on different grounds, and the Supreme Court declined to consider the case.Another important line of questions in this area will not involve a case in which she issued an opinion, but two important consolidated cases that the Supreme Court will hear next term.In Students for Fair Admission v. President & Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admission v. University of North Carolina, the justices will reconsider whether racial preferences in college admissions are constitutional.In both cases, the admissions policies make it significantly more likely that black applicants will be admitted—and significantly less likely that Asian American applicants will be admitted—than other similarly qualified applicants.Jackson will be asked whether she will commit to recuse herself from taking part in the consideration of those cases. This is a legitimate question. While Jackson was not involved in the disposition of either of these cases as they wended their way through the lower courts, she has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers since 2016.As Ed Whelan, a senior fellow and former president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, has noted, this is not a ministerial position. The board, which meets multiple times a year, “provides counsel to the University’s leadership on priorities, plans, and strategic initiatives.”It is hard to imagine that the ongoing lawsuit challenging Harvard’s admission’s policy was not the subject of intense discussion among the board and the university’s leadership.And interestingly, in her submitted questionnaire on pages 121 and 122, Jackson states that she recused herself in a couple of cases that bear a striking resemblance to this situation.She recused herself in Doe v. Lhamon “because the complaint challenged the Department of Education’s sexual assault guidelines for colleges and universities, and at the time that the matter was assigned to me, I was serving on the board of a university that was evaluating its own potential response to those guidelines.”Is there any doubt that she was referring to Harvard?And she recused herself in Chenari v. George Washington University “because the plaintiff alleged that George Washington University improperly terminated his enrollment at the school for honor code violations, and at the time this matter came before me, I was affiliated with George Washington University Law School as an adjunct professor.”Suffice it to say that being on the board of overseers of a university is a much more serious “affiliation” than being an adjunct professor.These are just a few of the opinions that are likely to be scrutinized by senators during the upcoming hearing that should yield insights as to how Jackson decides cases and whether she does so in an impartial manner, focusing exclusively on the law and not her personal or political predilections.Senators should ask tough and probing questions of Jackson in order to learn more about her judicial philosophy and approach to resolving legal disputes, both of which are vital considerations as they decide whether to confirm her to the high court.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "title:  Saga of Postal “Reform” Bill: Pricey Little Sideshow in 3 Acts\n",
            "text Last week, amid Russia’s ruthless invasion of Ukraine and the rapid passage of a massive 2,741-page, $1.5 trillion spending bill, it’s not surprising that enactment of a postal reform bill (H.R. 3076) got little attention.Touted as a long-awaited “bipartisan” measure, the postal legislation, 15 years in gestation, is anything but noncontroversial.Fast-tracked through Congress, the bill shifts tens of billions of dollars in liabilities from what is supposed to be the “self-financing” U.S. Postal Service to federal taxpayers.If the Postal Service had a company name like “JP Morgan” one could imagine how such a bailout would have drawn immediate opposition from across the political spectrum.   How did such a thing happen? Here’s how this little drama unfolded:Act 1, Scene 1:  House Fast-Tracks Passage  On Feb. 8, with the support of the Biden administration and the powerful postal unions, the House of Representatives passed the Postal Reform Act by a vote of 342 to 92. One might have expected that House Republicans would have at least had second thoughts, but instead, 120 House Republicans joined the Democratic majority.  Act 2, Scene 1: Sen. Scott’s ObjectionThe House bill appeared to be on a smooth glide path to Senate passage. But Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., raised fiscal concerns, requested the Senate take a closer look at the bill, and said he would offer an amendment.So, on Feb. 14, when the bill was brought to the Senate floor for consideration under the Senate’s unanimous consent rule, Scott objected.He did so for good reason: The Postal Service had accumulated tens of billions of dollars in unfunded obligations for postal retiree health costs. (In 2020, the Government Accountability Office estimated those costs at $75 billion.)With the legislative reorganization of Postal Service health care financing, those very real costs do not simply disappear. Instead, the House bill  shifts those costs onto the taxpayer by dumping them onto the financially troubled Medicare program.In explaining his objection, Scott told his colleagues that he simply wanted the Congressional Budget Office to examine the long-term impact of such a major cost shift on the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. And, as Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., noted, there was no Senate hearing on this measure, nor any Senate debate at all.Scott’s objection was reasonable. While the U.S. Postal Service has been bleeding billions of dollars for years, Medicare, the huge federal health program serving senior citizens, is also in serious financial trouble. In four short years, Medicare’s huge hospital program faces insolvency, meaning that, unless Congress acts, Medicare patients face serious benefit payment cuts.Medicare spending is accelerating at warp speed, and it, too, is generating an enormous taxpayer debt in the form of long-term unfunded obligations.Medicare’s trustees estimate the program’s long-term unfunded obligations at $48.3 trillion, the dollar amount of benefits promised, but not financed. That is equivalent to $150,000 per American.More to Scott’s point, with Medicare spending accelerating, piling on billions of dollars of additional unfunded obligations is pouring gasoline on Medicare’s fiscal fires.The House postal bill also imposes a costly mandate on postal retirees. Because the bill forces future postal retirees out of the superior Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) into traditional Medicare for primary coverage, they would now have to buy supplemental coverage, and pay two premiums rather than one, to fill crucial benefit gaps, including catastrophic coverage.This supplemental coverage fuels excess demand and drives up Medicare beneficiary and taxpayer costs even more.Act 2, Scene 2: CBO ReportWhile the CBO did not account for these unfunded obligations in its estimate, or the House bill’s budgetary effects for the next 20 years, as Scott requested, the senator learned from the CBO that the bill would add at least $5 billion to the nation’s deficits.The CBO also dropped a nasty bomblet. It said that, even with enactment of the House bill, it was still “unclear” how the Postal Service would pay for its “ongoing obligations” for health care, including health care for its retirees, after 2031.Act 2, Scene 3: Scott’s AmendmentCongressional bill sponsors simply ignored or downplayed the Medicare cost issue.So, Scott announced a simple amendment: In any transition of postal retirees to full Medicare coverage, the Postal Service should be required to reimburse the Medicare program for any additional costs.If the Medicare cost issue was not a problem, then logically there could be no objection.   The Postal Service, as noted, is supposed to be a self–financing agency. It is, of course, failing as a self-financing agency, running up billions of dollars in annual deficits, and accumulating, according to the GAO, a breathtaking $188 billion (about $580 per person in the U.S.) in debt.That debt includes, of course, its huge unfunded health and pension obligations. In short, the agency is a financial mess.In offering his amendment, Scott asked his Senate colleagues in effect whether America’s taxpayers should be targeted for such a massive cost-shift—a cost-shift that is justified only by the agency’s notorious financial failures.   Act 3, Scene 1: Senate Floor VotesOn March 8, the Senate took up the postal reform bill.Under the prevailing Senate rule, Scott asked for unanimous consent for the Senate to consider and vote on his amendment to require the Postal Service to reimburse the Medicare program for the additional Medicare costs.Johnson, along with Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla.; Mike Braun, R-Ind.;  and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, cosponsored the amendment. Senate Democrats then objected, and blocked consideration of, and a vote on, the Scott amendment.As noted, the CBO confirmed the bill would add to the deficit. So, Scott then made a “point of order” against the bill because it violated the Senate’s budget rules. In response, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,  a socialist, made a motion that the Senate waive the budget rules to advance the House bill. Remarkably, Sanders’ motion passed by a vote of 68 to 30, garnering support from a surprising number of Republican senators.After blocking debate on Scott’s amendment and waiving the budget rules, the Senate passed the House postal bill by a lopsided 79-19 vote.Alas, conscientious lawmakers are often in the minority.    CurtainsThough the postal reform debate is over, at least for now, Scott’s performance was a profile in statesmanship.The senator knows that the bigger and broader Medicare debate is inevitable, and that Medicare’s future financial stability is essential to fulfilling its promise to deliver high-quality care to a large and growing cohort of senior citizens.Medicare reform will soon be among America’s greatest policy challenges.Scott also reminded his colleagues that throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at a problem is not a solution.Bailouts are no substitute for real postal reform, as Heritage analysts have long insisted, and taxpayers’ pockets are not inexhaustible. Maybe next time, they will listen.This piece originally appeared in \n",

            "title:  Securing U.S. Maritime Rights in Our Unguarded Waters\n",
            "text The U.S. is engaged in a strategic competition with China across the political, economic, and military spectrum, and maritime security and resource protection is an important but often overlooked aspect of this competition. As recent events make evident, the potential incursion of a large Chinese fishing fleet protected by paramilitary units into U.S. waters is here. The challenge is such that any response must act in concert with Pacific allies to secure significant U.S. economic, military, and ecological interests. The threat is greatest in U.S. waters of the South and Central Pacific, where prompt action is most needed.This response will require improved maritime policing, defense, and improvement of associated infrastructure, especially in the lightly patrolled South and Central Pacific. Improving the posture of the U.S. Coast Guard and dedicating platforms and resources to the existing security coordinating body—the Pacific Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), consisting of Australia, France, New Zealand, and the U.S.—can achieve some early results economically, but is only a start to addressing the larger challenge.  In July 2020, over 300 Chinese fishing vessels gathered around—and sometimes in—the protected waters of Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands. At the time, the potential loss of endangered species in the Galapagos Marine Reserve and blighting of a UNESCO World Heritage site enraged many with a conservationist bent. Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno saw also potential economic loss, and it was enough for him to seek multinational action.REF However, China’s global industrial fishing fleet is not just Ecuador’s problem, but a U.S. one as well.In an arc stretching over 1,400 miles from Wake Island to Johnston Atoll and south 1,900 miles to American Samoa are six U.S. exclusive economic zones (EEZ), rich in fish and untapped natural resources. To protect the coral reefs and associated biodiversity, four Pacific marine national monuments were established by President George W. Bush in 2009.REFIn this arc are two marine national monuments, the Pacific Remote Islands (495,189 square miles), and Rose Atoll (13,436 square miles).REF Without improved U.S. maritime capacity and allied coordination these U.S. maritime rights are at risk. However, it is far from just about fish: Should a conflict erupt in Asia, the U.S. will rely on secure shipping and air freight across the region to support military operations.China’s fishing fleets are globally significant both economically and ecologically. Since 2011, China’s appetite for seafood has driven imports—tripling to $15 billion in 2019 and pushing its fishing fleets further afield. Today they make up 38 percent of all global fishing activity.REFEcological. The ecological impacts are evident: Chinese “dark” fishing fleets have surged into the Sea of Japan to catch squid, which, since 2003, have faced significant population declines.REF Chinese distant fishing fleets are affecting American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaiian fisheries; the overall revenue loss to illegal fishing in the Pacific is estimated to be between $4.3 billion to $8.3 billion.REFRegulatory. Complicating matters is that these distant-water fishing fleets are largely unregulated. Nominal responsibility for this resides with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, operating under the guidance of China’s Fisheries Law, now in its fifth version since its 1986 inception. However, these regulations lean more toward advocacy than restrictions. Their provisions include providing financial support, fuel subsidies, and tax exemptions.REFAdditionally, while China’s distant-water fishing fleet is largely off-the-books, it has been estimated to consist of up to 17,000 ships by using location data (e.g., AIS location data) and unique vessel identifier databases (e.g., Krakken’s FishSpektrum). Attempts to regulate this fleet are further hampered by opaque registration and ownership processes.REFStrategic. Likewise, Chinese maritime forces have shown a predilection to protect—not regulate—Chinese fishing fleets. Chinese overseas enforcement is the responsibility of the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG), potentially supported by the paramilitary maritime militia that frequently operates in and amongst fishing fleets. This is worrisome, given the reporting by the China Maritime Studies Institute regarding these forces’ frequent use of intimidation in the South China Sea.REFDrift-Net Fishing. There is, however, one bright spot. Since joining the North Pacific Coast Guard Forum in 2000, the CCG has coordinated enforcement of the United Nation’s ban on drift-net fishing in the North Pacific.REF Sadly, this bright spot may be dimming. Despite past good relations between U.S. and Chinese Coast Guards, alarms were raised in September 2021 when a Chinese naval four-ship flotilla was unexpectedly encountered in Alaskan waters. At the same time a separately deployed CCG flotilla was nearby, indicating China has the capacity to protect its fishing fleets as far afield as Alaska.REFThen, in January 2022, the CCG escorted six Chinese Fisheries Company vessels that were threatened by pirates in the Gulf Aden.REF Such missions should be welcomed, but optimism regarding China being a responsible maritime stakeholder is likely misplaced, given the CCG’s track record of not restraining its fleets from poaching or harmful coral harvesting, especially in the South China Sea.REF It remains an open question whether drift-net ban enforcement by the CCG can be extended more broadly to counter wider concerns of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.Without clear signs that the Chinese Communist Party will restrain its fishing fleets, there is growing potential for confrontation regarding fishing rights in the U.S. EEZ. Since the U.S. has the world’s most extensive maritime claims, it has a large area of vulnerable territory.REF It is likely Chinese fleets have attempted or will soon attempt to poach at scale in U.S. waters, and in that future scenario, U.S. fisheries valued at $5.6 billion could be put at risk.REF According to U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz, “IUU fishing has replaced piracy as the leading global maritime security threat.” The cost of global IUU fishing is estimated to be in the billions of dollars per year.Following the Galapagos crisis amidst international awareness of IUU fishing, the U.S. Coast Guard released a strategic vision to combat IUU fishing. Actualizing that strategy, however, remains a work in progress.U.S. Fisheries. U.S. fisheries are dispersed throughout its Pacific and Atlantic exclusive economic zones, but there are a few areas that stand out as especially important. The two primary ports for American fishing are New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. New Bedford has the highest value in catch, and Dutch Harbor has the highest catch by volume. By value, the Atlantic catch is responsible for approximately 39 percent and, among the rest, Alaskan waters alone account for 32 percent. The rest of the Pacific (i.e., American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii, etc.) accounts for 12 percent of U.S. seafood by value.REF Given that 20 percent of all catches are from IUU fishing—and that U.S. waters span a vast area consisting of remote U.S. territories—makes it difficult to patrol. All this means that America could lose up to $1 billion worth of lost catches in U.S. waters to IUU fishing.It is the Coast Guard’s and Navy’s responsibility to protect the nation’s maritime rights. But there are serious questions regarding the capacity of U.S. forces to address large-scale Chinese fishing fleets like those seen around the Galapagos Islands. The Navy supports the Coast Guard in its maritime security mission by periodically (on average, twice a year) assigning ships to the Oceania Maritime Security Initiative. This effort embarks Coast Guard personnel on Navy ships to improve maritime security and maritime domain awareness in the Pacific. However, due to operational demands on the Navy, these missions have been infrequent.Coast Guard Response. The Coast Guard is the best tool for enforcing U.S. laws in its EEZs and has the responsibility for protecting marine and other resources, but consistent underinvestment has left it poorly positioned to address growing challenges. In recent years, the Coast Guard has sought to increase its assets based in the Pacific. Today, the Coast Guard’s District 14 patrols the South, Central, and Western Pacific with 10 cutters and maritime patrol aircraft.REF To increase this fleet, in July 2021, the Coast Guard commissioned three new Guam-based Fast Response Cutters.REF These smaller cutters are helpful, but alone are inadequate to cover the vast spaces of U.S. Pacific EEZs. Instead, these three new cutters will likely focus on the nearby EEZs of Guam and the Northern Marinas Islands.Amidst increasing Chinese maritime presence, while still meeting national requirements, adequately patrolling U.S. waters in the Pacific requires a larger fleet. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 11 high-endurance National Security Cutters and 25 medium-endurance Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC).REF Those cutters are planned to equip the Coast Guard for patrols covering all U.S. waters and conduct limited overseas deployments with the Navy.Fleet Numbers. This planned fleet is likely inadequate given the scale of the maritime challenge from Chinese fishing fleets and its military. A 2011 Coast Guard study estimated that its planned acquisitions would only provide 61 percent of the cutters needed to fulfill the Coast Guard’s missions, and a later analysis found it could take up to 57 OPCs to meet mission demands.REF The study identified coverage gaps for various mission sets given the shortfalls of fleet capacity; assessed a high risk for the protection of marine life mission set; and warned of a very high risk for defense readiness, search and rescue, and counter-narcotic mission sets in various areas.This assessment assumes the Coast Guard’s acquisition plan or “Program of Record” is completely funded.REF It also should be noted that China markedly stepped up its aggression and hostile acts in the years following 2011, which is not accounted for in the Coast Guard’s study. However, until the Coast Guard revises its 2004 Program of Record (its last official statement on the required fleet size), it remains uncertain how it will meet contemporary maritime challenges and with what resources.Complicating the Coast Guard’s and the Navy’s efforts to improve presence in this region is the lack of any permanently based ships. The closest bases are in Guam and Hawaii, which include extensive EEZ patrol areas of their own. The problem is amplified as the existing infrastructure (ports, airfields) is antiquated, most dating to World War II or to the nation’s early space program, such as the airfield at Canton Island, Kiribati, which was shuttered in 1976. Needed are more naval forces in the region and their longer-term sustainment in the South and Central Pacific. These include ports, repairs facilities, and airfields. Thankfully, the U.S. is not alone in the region.Stronger collective action is a good first step to better safeguarding U.S. maritime rights in the South and Central Pacific. Allies Australia, France, and New Zealand are capable and resident partners in the Central and South Pacific. France has stationed significant forces (two surveillance Frigates, three patrol vessels, and five maritime patrol aircraft) and has territory (New Caledonia and French Polynesia) in the Pacific. Furthermore, France is a member of the Pacific QUAD (which includes Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.) for coordinating security matters, and, as party to the 1992 FRANZ Agreement, coordinates regional humanitarian assistance with Australia and New Zealand.REFAustralia is an important regional partner. Central to its efforts is the Pacific Maritime Security Program, a $2 billion (Australian dollars), 30-year commitment of in-country staff sustaining a fleet of 21 patrol boats transferred to 12 Pacific island nations, providing regional aerial surveillance, and underwriting efforts to enhance regional coordination.REF However, the September 2021 grounding of Samoa’sREF single Australian-donated patrol boat exposed the limits of the program, leaving the island with no way of patrolling its waters and, therefore, reliant on partner nations.REFLast, New Zealand has limited resources devoted to the region: 131 maritime patrol flying hours and 64 days at sea in fisheries patrols covering its 1.6 million square mile EEZ.REF Given their extensive and dispersed EEZs, individually these allies are hard-pressed to respond to large-scale poaching in their waters. However, better information-sharing and collective action can effectively focus limited naval resources to address the risk of large-scale IUU fishing and protect important sea-lanes.But there is more at play than fish in the great-power competition with China for the Pacific. For decades, a diplomatic contest between Taiwan and China has played out over flipping diplomatic recognition between the two. Militarily, America’s decades-long dominance of the Pacific is fading. Notable are Russian long-range bomber deployments, like that to Indonesia in December 2017, as well as repeated distant Chinese naval deployments. Such deployments by our adversaries make clear the Pacific is being contested and can no longer be considered an American lake.Today the South and Central Pacific includes critical sea and air lanes that support military operations in Asia, long assumed to be beyond any threat. This is no longer a viable military assumption, given Chinese and Russian long-range Pacific deployments, once again making the region of keen strategic importance.Given the paucity of U.S. naval presence and the associated inadequate capacity to patrol its own EEZ, the following actions are offered for consideration.Establish a Southern and Central Pacific Maritime Security Headquarters and Expand Support Infrastructure. To focus resources and enable better regional coordination, the U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area Command and Indo–Pacific Command should establish a detachment in American Samoa. This headquarters’ mission would be to identify and execute needed maritime training and infrastructure projects supporting a sustained maritime security presence, while synchronizing operational (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard’s Operation Blue PacificREF) and capacity-building activities with regional partners.In time, this could include attached units like military construction battalions (e.g., Navy Seabees and Army Corps of Engineers) and home-porting Coast Guard cutters. Additionally, this headquarters would coordinate episodic naval deployments by allies like Japan and the United Kingdom to the region. This will become important, given that the United Kingdom has deployed two patrol ships to the Pacific until 2026. They are expected to periodically operate in this region.REFConduct Annual Pacific QUAD Naval Exercises in the South and Central Pacific. The focus should be to practice wartime logistics, maritime patrol, convoy operations, and interdiction of large fishing fleets (e.g., the 2020 Galapagos Islands incident). The first iteration of this exercise should be coordinated to occur in conjunction with the establishment of the headquarters in American Samoa overseeing these exercises. Additionally, given Japan’s growing and welcome diplomatic footprint in the region, there may be value in announcing the launch of this exercise from one of its regional embassies. This could also be beneficial in highlighting the economic and policing aspects of these exercises throughout the region. Allowance should be made for future participation of Pacific island nation navies, notably from Fiji and Tonga.Standardize Maritime Policing Practices with Pacific Island Nations and Pacific QUAD Members. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been good use of virtual policing to enable a land-based third party to authorize maritime policing in its waters. This should be expanded and standardized so that, at a minimum, Pacific-QUAD members can support policing in all the participating nations’ EEZ.Create a Regionally Focused Maritime-Security-Capacity-Building Funding Account. For South and Central Pacific Island Nations, Congress should establish a security cooperation account like the Maritime Security Initiative of 2015.REF Likewise, to enable greater regional economic maritime development with military utility, the U.S. Secretary of Defense should identify ports and airfields to the Development Finance CorporationREF for favorable solicitation of investment proposals.The U.S. Coast Guard Should Increase Transparency on Its Fleet Needs by Updating Its Program of Record and Releasing a Report About the Degree of Risk It Is Accepting with Various Fleet Mixes. The lack of clear information on the Coast Guard’s fleet requirements makes it difficult for Congress to conduct effective oversight and for the public debate on new cutter acquisitions to be well-informed. Studies more than a decade old are still driving the debate—studies that do not take into account shifting mission demands and a dramatically changing global operating environment. In order to assist the Coast Guard to meet its missions, more information is required to inform the debate on the fleet.Develop Techniques for Countering Large-Scale IUU Fishing. Given the size of Chinese distant-waters fishing fleets, the U.S. Coast Guard’s training and techniques need to be developed and practiced to protect U.S. waters. These techniques must include countermeasures for dealing with Chinese maritime militia interspersed amidst large fishing fleets.Assess the Potential Value of Fishing and Implications of IUU Fishing in U.S. Waters. Congress should direct the U.S. Coast Guard, in concert with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide a report on the impact of illegal fishing on the U.S. fishing industry, impacts to local communities (e.g., American Samoa), and an update on the U.S. Coast Guard’s IUU Fishing Implementation Plan.Because of other operational requirements, today’s U.S. Navy is largely absent from the South and Central Pacific. Fortunately, the Coast Guard has not had to deal with large illegal Chinese fishing fleets in U.S. waters—yet. Nevertheless, the day when it will is fast approaching, and today it has limited ability to interdict such illicit maritime activity in U.S. Pacific EEZs. To fund the U.S. Coast Guard for this mission will take a different mindset, one that Congress, the Biden Administration, and the military need to realize and implement.Action is required to safeguard economic and security interests in this strategic region. Mobilizing the Pacific QUAD for maritime security is an important step until more Coast Guard cutters arrive. A visible and sustained maritime security presence in this region can deter IUU fishing while better securing critical sea and air lanes in the event of conflict in Asia.Moreover, the Coast Guard will be an important player in the nation’s strategic approach to China. The Coast Guard is, in fact, the best trained to take on peacetime competition in this region while building coalitions of like-minded nations. For too long, multiple Administrations have underappreciated and under-resourced the Coast Guard for its unavoidable role in great-power competition with China. This must change.Brent D.

            "title:  In a Period of Brute Force, China Increases Its Military Budget Yet Again\n",
            "text The Chinese Communist Party announced this week it will increase the budget for the People’s Liberation Army by 7.1%.The announcement occurred at the opening session of the National People’s Congress—the annual rubber-stamp parliament. Thus, it is just a matter of time before the extra resources start following to the People’s Liberation Army.This increase continues the trend of sustained increases in the Chinese military budget. Since 2018, the Chinese Communist Party has increased the People’s Liberation Army budget by over 28% with consecutive annual increases of between 8.1% and 6.6%.Contrast this with the U.S. defense budget, which grew little under 5% from 2018 to 2021. However, if you take inflation into account, the U.S. defense budget decreased by 3% in those four years.One of the party’s favorite propaganda vehicles, the Global Times, reported that “the proposed defense budget would mark the single-digit growth for seven consecutive years since 2016 and also a return to a 7-plus percent increase.”The return to an above 7% increase comes after successive years of double-digit growth, ranging from 10.7% to 13% in the earlier part of the 2010s. Further, the People’s Liberation Army is able to get more bang for its buck. As just one example, the Chinese labor costs are substantially lower than American labor costs, enabling them to field a bigger force while spending less.Additionally, China can impose its defense costs on its state-owned companies, shielding the People’s Liberation Army budget from these expenses.By any measure, the Chinese Communist Party has been steadily modernizing and investing in its armed forces with the overall goal of having a fully mechanized and informatized military by 2027.This is an assessment shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in its recently released annual threat assessment, which stated that “Beijing is accelerating the development of key capabilities it believes the People’s Liberation Army’s needs to confront the United States in a large-scale, sustained conflict.”The assessment further elaborates that “China will continue pursuing its goal of building a world-class military that will enable it to secure what it views as its sovereign territory, establish its preeminence in regional affairs, and project power globally while offsetting perceived U.S. military superiority.” Clearly the Intelligence Community believes that the Chinese Communist Party has the will to leverage brute force to impose its ideology, as exemplified by its brutal crackdown in Hong Kong.Today we are watching what an undeterred authoritarian power is capable of doing to subjugate its democratic neighbor in Ukraine, as Russian troops destroy cities and target civilian populations indiscriminately.The United States and the world will be paying close attention to the lessons that Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party leadership will derive from the Western response to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. The Chinese Communist Party is investing in building the capabilities it would need to subjugate and dominate its neighbors.One of the lessons to be learned is that dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin are only deterred by the prospect of a strong military response from determined allies. If we hope to deter China from similarly coercing its neighbors, a strong and capable U.S. military will be necessary.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust.It’s always chancy to unleash the dogs of war: You never know who they’re going to bite. With Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, all we know for sure is that, regardless of the outcome, the result won’t exactly be rosy for the Russian president. It does seem clear what Mr. Putin thought would happen. For some reason, his Kremlin crowd decided now was the time to swallow Ukraine whole, once and for all. Why?Perhaps it’s because they saw weakness in President Biden, as well as in a tentative cluster of European countries on the other side of Ukraine. He obviously gambled that they’d be unwilling to do much for Ukraine.>>> Germany Has Woken UpAs Mr. Putin massed his military, he thought that either the West would flinch and hand over the country, or Russian forces would invade in a lightning campaign, assassinate all the key government officials on day one or two, and frighten the Ukrainians into capitulation with their show of strength. After the West wouldn’t cut a deal, Mr. Putin rolled the dice on a quick win.Well, here we are in the second week of the two-day invasion, and the Ukrainian flag is still flying.There are still several possible outcomes. If Mr. Putin really wants to win—and since he has risked so much already—it’s too much to expect that he will easily back down. The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust, leaving a devastated country and masses of butchered innocents and refugees in his wake. That, now, is the “best” Mr. Putin can hope for.Here is why the most optimistic outcome for Mr. Putin is still bad news for him. For one, the cost will be astronomical. Mr. Biden, arguably, helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war with reckless energy policies that have oil prices rocketing to as much as $130 a barrel. While oil exports can help pay for the Putin war, the cost isn’t cheap. The protracted conflict is burning through Russian cash.The cost of occupying any wasteland Mr. Putin conquered would be higher. At the same time, the value of the Russian currency is crashing, blazing faster than a Russian helicopter shot down by a stinger missile. And sanctions are going to make doing business worldwide much more difficult.After Ukraine, Mr. Putin might want to move on to other targets including lands where Russia is already a threatening influence—in the Balkans, Moldova, and Georgia, or even NATO territory like the Baltic states. At best, though, the Russian military would have to pause and regroup.NATO, for one, would likely be a much more difficult target. Mr. Putin has inadvertently finished President Trump’s work for him. The allies’ rush to beef up defense capabilities—led by, of all countries, Germany—is surely not a scenario Mr. Putin had hoped for. If the momentum continues, Mr. Putin will face a military stalemate.Further, if this crisis propels America and Europe to face the need to come up with responsible policies that deliver affordable, reliable, and abundant energy without relying on Russia, Mr. Putin will lose his two main weapons to intimidate the West: military and energy blackmail. >>> What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWorse, Mr. Putin’s only remaining friend of consequence is China. That’s like saying the only person who has Jason Voorhees’s back is Freddy Krueger. Beijing can’t be happy it’s had to shill for Mr. Putin’s inexcusable war of aggression. That only makes China look like an accomplice. It can’t bail out the enormous backsliding of the Russian economy.As for President Xi’s claim that he was misled by Mr. Putin: nonsense. Sure, China hopes to avoid blow-back from the anger that the free world is heaping on Moscow, but it’s all in for Russia and will do what it can to help. While this all seems bad for Mr. Putin, it could be an even worse winter in Moscow if Ukrainians continue their heroic stand and his forces can’t conquer the country.None of Mr. Putin’s misery should give us joy. His tragedy was born of greater tragedy. Forty-four million Ukrainians were thrown to the wolves because Mr. Biden couldn’t muster a response to Mr. Putin’s threat.The greatest leaders prevent the wars of tyrants by peace through strength. Mr. Biden looks like the fireman who took a day off and let the arsonist run wild.This piece originally appeared in The Sun \n",

            "text Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped to unify Europe against Russia, it has had a divisive effect in the Middle East, where many countries recently have hedged their bets by boosting ties to Moscow to offset declining confidence in U.S. leadership.Even before the Biden administration’s Afghanistan withdrawal debacle last August, U.S. allies and partners in the Middle East were dismayed by a downsizing of the U.S. military presence in the region, incessant talk of an American “pivot” to Asia, and the administration’s commitment to restoring the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.  They rightfully fear that another weak nuclear deal will allow Tehran to pocket billions of dollars and escalate its military and terrorist threats against its neighbors.These reservations about U.S. policy also have hampered cooperation with regional allies and partners on mitigating the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting U.S. sanctions on Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.While announcing the ban on Russian oil imports to the U.S. on Tuesday, President Joe Biden acknowledged that oil prices could surge higher and sought to pin the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin:This decision today is not without costs here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the pump—and this will drive up costs further. So, I will take every step we can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.But Biden’s efforts to lobby for increased oil production from Middle Eastern oil exporters have failed to produce adequate alternatives to the Russian oil.  Washington initially was rebuffed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the only oil exporters that have significant untapped oil production capacity.The two countries announced that they were sticking to an oil production agreement struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC oil producers led by Russia.The United Arab Emirates later moderated its initial position in a statement released on Wednesday by Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba: “We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels.”Gulf Arabs Snub BidenTo make matters worse, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the United Arab Emirates’ Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both recently declined U.S. requests to speak to Biden by phone. Both, however, took phone calls the previous week from Putin.This snub of Biden stands in stark contrast to Saudi behavior in 2018, when it ramped up oil exports to stabilize oil prices after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran.The Saudis and Emiratis feel neglected by the Biden administration, which they assess has failed to adequately respond to mounting threats to their security posed by Iran and its proxy militias.   Both governments were stung by Biden’s criticism of their military intervention in Yemen, the freezing of some U.S. arms sales to their armed forces, and the withdrawal last year of U.S. military forces and missile defenses from their countries at a time when they face rising threats from Iranian drones and missiles, including many launched by Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen.The Biden administration also burned its bridges to the crown prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Biden promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to treat the crown prince as a pariah for his role in the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The Biden administration’s cold shoulder encouraged the Saudis and Emiratis to hedge their bets on U.S. security guarantees by trying to improve their relations with Russia, China, and even Iran.Time to recalibrate U.S. Mideast policyAlthough the Biden administration has been quick to blame Putin for spiking global energy prices, its own flawed energy policies also have contributed to the current energy predicament. The administration has undermined U.S. energy security in its rush to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources that will not be scaling up fast enough to support that transition anytime soon. That trade-off has now become more visible.The Biden administration’s reported overtures to Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for increased oil supplies have rightfully raised eyebrows. This objectionable option could have been avoided if the administration had maintained better relations with major Arab oil kingdoms.The Biden administration needs to recalibrate its Middle East policy to give a higher priority to energy security and the need to deter and defend against a broad spectrum of Iranian threats to regional security.   Perhaps then it could depend on the full cooperation of long-term partners in the Middle East who have harbored increasing doubts about U.S. security guarantees. Maybe then they would even agree to accept a phone call from the White House.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text Red Hill has been leaking for years due to crumbling infrastructure. Yet the problem at this important Navy underground fuel storage facility in Hawaii went unaddressed for years. Now, it threatens the island’s major aquifer, forcing the government’s hand. Sadly, the government has reacted in a typical knee-jerk fashion. We must do better to deal with all the dangers involved. The facility now poses a serious health risk. But there is more at stake than drinking water. Red Hill plays a critical part in meeting the logistic needs of the Navy. It is where we store the fuels that keep the Pacific Fleet sailing. This critical military asset looms even more important as war rages in Europe and tensions with China grow. The nation needs a smart solution that addresses the health concerns of those living on the island without endangering national security. >>> How the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023 Should Prepare the Military for Great-Power CompetitionBuilt in 1943, Red Hill today is surrounded by family housing. Two major leaks occurred last year, threatening to contaminate the island’s main aquifer. They were by no means the first leaks. Concerns with Red Hill contaminating drinking water date back to at least 2002, when groundwater monitoring was begun.The latest leaks, however, galvanized local leaders to demand action. On March 7th, they got it. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered that the World War II era facility be emptied and abandoned within a year. He set a May 31 deadline for coming up with a plan that would assure the safety of Hawaii’s drinking water without jeopardizing the fleet’s ability to serve its vital security mission. The Defense Department has released a fact sheet giving some clues on what this plan may look like. The key appears to be distributing fuel storage among various commercial sites (assumed to be in Hawaii) and tankers.Tankers can provide a viable and mobile option, but their use raises several questions. Where will the tankers load and where will they transfer fuel to the warships? Will these tankers be newly acquired and crewed or drawn from an already inadequate fleet of commercial ready reserve vessels? >>> The Biden Administration Needs To Get Serious About National DefenseLots of details need to be worked out to ensure the Navy remains ready amidst a rapidly worsening security environment. It seems quite doubtful that relying on tankers alone can address the logistic needs of the Pacific Fleet. Moreover, the fact sheet did not address the need for secure drinking water in Hawaii.And therein lies the problem. We have set a deadline for closing Red Hill without conditioning that on having a viable and proven alternative in place. That is dangerous. A more prudent course of action would have been to set a deadline for providing an alternative water source in Hawaii and a Red Hill replacement. Congress and the Department of Defense both bear responsibility for neglecting military infrastructure for decades. Now, they must act. But they need not—and must not--act rashly.This piece originally appeared in RealClearDefense \n",

            "text The U.S. is engaged in a strategic competition with China across the political, economic, and military spectrum, and maritime security and resource protection is an important but often overlooked aspect of this competition. As recent events make evident, the potential incursion of a large Chinese fishing fleet protected by paramilitary units into U.S. waters is here. The challenge is such that any response must act in concert with Pacific allies to secure significant U.S. economic, military, and ecological interests. The threat is greatest in U.S. waters of the South and Central Pacific, where prompt action is most needed.This response will require improved maritime policing, defense, and improvement of associated infrastructure, especially in the lightly patrolled South and Central Pacific. Improving the posture of the U.S. Coast Guard and dedicating platforms and resources to the existing security coordinating body—the Pacific Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), consisting of Australia, France, New Zealand, and the U.S.—can achieve some early results economically, but is only a start to addressing the larger challenge.  In July 2020, over 300 Chinese fishing vessels gathered around—and sometimes in—the protected waters of Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands. At the time, the potential loss of endangered species in the Galapagos Marine Reserve and blighting of a UNESCO World Heritage site enraged many with a conservationist bent. Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno saw also potential economic loss, and it was enough for him to seek multinational action.REF However, China’s global industrial fishing fleet is not just Ecuador’s problem, but a U.S. one as well.In an arc stretching over 1,400 miles from Wake Island to Johnston Atoll and south 1,900 miles to American Samoa are six U.S. exclusive economic zones (EEZ), rich in fish and untapped natural resources. To protect the coral reefs and associated biodiversity, four Pacific marine national monuments were established by President George W. Bush in 2009.REFIn this arc are two marine national monuments, the Pacific Remote Islands (495,189 square miles), and Rose Atoll (13,436 square miles).REF Without improved U.S. maritime capacity and allied coordination these U.S. maritime rights are at risk. However, it is far from just about fish: Should a conflict erupt in Asia, the U.S. will rely on secure shipping and air freight across the region to support military operations.China’s fishing fleets are globally significant both economically and ecologically. Since 2011, China’s appetite for seafood has driven imports—tripling to $15 billion in 2019 and pushing its fishing fleets further afield. Today they make up 38 percent of all global fishing activity.REFEcological. The ecological impacts are evident: Chinese “dark” fishing fleets have surged into the Sea of Japan to catch squid, which, since 2003, have faced significant population declines.REF Chinese distant fishing fleets are affecting American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaiian fisheries; the overall revenue loss to illegal fishing in the Pacific is estimated to be between $4.3 billion to $8.3 billion.REFRegulatory. Complicating matters is that these distant-water fishing fleets are largely unregulated. Nominal responsibility for this resides with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, operating under the guidance of China’s Fisheries Law, now in its fifth version since its 1986 inception. However, these regulations lean more toward advocacy than restrictions. Their provisions include providing financial support, fuel subsidies, and tax exemptions.REFAdditionally, while China’s distant-water fishing fleet is largely off-the-books, it has been estimated to consist of up to 17,000 ships by using location data (e.g., AIS location data) and unique vessel identifier databases (e.g., Krakken’s FishSpektrum). Attempts to regulate this fleet are further hampered by opaque registration and ownership processes.REFStrategic. Likewise, Chinese maritime forces have shown a predilection to protect—not regulate—Chinese fishing fleets. Chinese overseas enforcement is the responsibility of the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG), potentially supported by the paramilitary maritime militia that frequently operates in and amongst fishing fleets. This is worrisome, given the reporting by the China Maritime Studies Institute regarding these forces’ frequent use of intimidation in the South China Sea.REFDrift-Net Fishing. There is, however, one bright spot. Since joining the North Pacific Coast Guard Forum in 2000, the CCG has coordinated enforcement of the United Nation’s ban on drift-net fishing in the North Pacific.REF Sadly, this bright spot may be dimming. Despite past good relations between U.S. and Chinese Coast Guards, alarms were raised in September 2021 when a Chinese naval four-ship flotilla was unexpectedly encountered in Alaskan waters. At the same time a separately deployed CCG flotilla was nearby, indicating China has the capacity to protect its fishing fleets as far afield as Alaska.REFThen, in January 2022, the CCG escorted six Chinese Fisheries Company vessels that were threatened by pirates in the Gulf Aden.REF Such missions should be welcomed, but optimism regarding China being a responsible maritime stakeholder is likely misplaced, given the CCG’s track record of not restraining its fleets from poaching or harmful coral harvesting, especially in the South China Sea.REF It remains an open question whether drift-net ban enforcement by the CCG can be extended more broadly to counter wider concerns of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.Without clear signs that the Chinese Communist Party will restrain its fishing fleets, there is growing potential for confrontation regarding fishing rights in the U.S. EEZ. Since the U.S. has the world’s most extensive maritime claims, it has a large area of vulnerable territory.REF It is likely Chinese fleets have attempted or will soon attempt to poach at scale in U.S. waters, and in that future scenario, U.S. fisheries valued at $5.6 billion could be put at risk.REF According to U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz, “IUU fishing has replaced piracy as the leading global maritime security threat.” The cost of global IUU fishing is estimated to be in the billions of dollars per year.Following the Galapagos crisis amidst international awareness of IUU fishing, the U.S. Coast Guard released a strategic vision to combat IUU fishing. Actualizing that strategy, however, remains a work in progress.U.S. Fisheries. U.S. fisheries are dispersed throughout its Pacific and Atlantic exclusive economic zones, but there are a few areas that stand out as especially important. The two primary ports for American fishing are New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. New Bedford has the highest value in catch, and Dutch Harbor has the highest catch by volume. By value, the Atlantic catch is responsible for approximately 39 percent and, among the rest, Alaskan waters alone account for 32 percent. The rest of the Pacific (i.e., American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii, etc.) accounts for 12 percent of U.S. seafood by value.REF Given that 20 percent of all catches are from IUU fishing—and that U.S. waters span a vast area consisting of remote U.S. territories—makes it difficult to patrol. All this means that America could lose up to $1 billion worth of lost catches in U.S. waters to IUU fishing.It is the Coast Guard’s and Navy’s responsibility to protect the nation’s maritime rights. But there are serious questions regarding the capacity of U.S. forces to address large-scale Chinese fishing fleets like those seen around the Galapagos Islands. The Navy supports the Coast Guard in its maritime security mission by periodically (on average, twice a year) assigning ships to the Oceania Maritime Security Initiative. This effort embarks Coast Guard personnel on Navy ships to improve maritime security and maritime domain awareness in the Pacific. However, due to operational demands on the Navy, these missions have been infrequent.Coast Guard Response. The Coast Guard is the best tool for enforcing U.S. laws in its EEZs and has the responsibility for protecting marine and other resources, but consistent underinvestment has left it poorly positioned to address growing challenges. In recent years, the Coast Guard has sought to increase its assets based in the Pacific. Today, the Coast Guard’s District 14 patrols the South, Central, and Western Pacific with 10 cutters and maritime patrol aircraft.REF To increase this fleet, in July 2021, the Coast Guard commissioned three new Guam-based Fast Response Cutters.REF These smaller cutters are helpful, but alone are inadequate to cover the vast spaces of U.S. Pacific EEZs. Instead, these three new cutters will likely focus on the nearby EEZs of Guam and the Northern Marinas Islands.Amidst increasing Chinese maritime presence, while still meeting national requirements, adequately patrolling U.S. waters in the Pacific requires a larger fleet. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 11 high-endurance National Security Cutters and 25 medium-endurance Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC).REF Those cutters are planned to equip the Coast Guard for patrols covering all U.S. waters and conduct limited overseas deployments with the Navy.Fleet Numbers. This planned fleet is likely inadequate given the scale of the maritime challenge from Chinese fishing fleets and its military. A 2011 Coast Guard study estimated that its planned acquisitions would only provide 61 percent of the cutters needed to fulfill the Coast Guard’s missions, and a later analysis found it could take up to 57 OPCs to meet mission demands.REF The study identified coverage gaps for various mission sets given the shortfalls of fleet capacity; assessed a high risk for the protection of marine life mission set; and warned of a very high risk for defense readiness, search and rescue, and counter-narcotic mission sets in various areas.This assessment assumes the Coast Guard’s acquisition plan or “Program of Record” is completely funded.REF It also should be noted that China markedly stepped up its aggression and hostile acts in the years following 2011, which is not accounted for in the Coast Guard’s study. However, until the Coast Guard revises its 2004 Program of Record (its last official statement on the required fleet size), it remains uncertain how it will meet contemporary maritime challenges and with what resources.Complicating the Coast Guard’s and the Navy’s efforts to improve presence in this region is the lack of any permanently based ships. The closest bases are in Guam and Hawaii, which include extensive EEZ patrol areas of their own. The problem is amplified as the existing infrastructure (ports, airfields) is antiquated, most dating to World War II or to the nation’s early space program, such as the airfield at Canton Island, Kiribati, which was shuttered in 1976. Needed are more naval forces in the region and their longer-term sustainment in the South and Central Pacific. These include ports, repairs facilities, and airfields. Thankfully, the U.S. is not alone in the region.Stronger collective action is a good first step to better safeguarding U.S. maritime rights in the South and Central Pacific. Allies Australia, France, and New Zealand are capable and resident partners in the Central and South Pacific. France has stationed significant forces (two surveillance Frigates, three patrol vessels, and five maritime patrol aircraft) and has territory (New Caledonia and French Polynesia) in the Pacific. Furthermore, France is a member of the Pacific QUAD (which includes Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.) for coordinating security matters, and, as party to the 1992 FRANZ Agreement, coordinates regional humanitarian assistance with Australia and New Zealand.REFAustralia is an important regional partner. Central to its efforts is the Pacific Maritime Security Program, a $2 billion (Australian dollars), 30-year commitment of in-country staff sustaining a fleet of 21 patrol boats transferred to 12 Pacific island nations, providing regional aerial surveillance, and underwriting efforts to enhance regional coordination.REF However, the September 2021 grounding of Samoa’sREF single Australian-donated patrol boat exposed the limits of the program, leaving the island with no way of patrolling its waters and, therefore, reliant on partner nations.REFLast, New Zealand has limited resources devoted to the region: 131 maritime patrol flying hours and 64 days at sea in fisheries patrols covering its 1.6 million square mile EEZ.REF Given their extensive and dispersed EEZs, individually these allies are hard-pressed to respond to large-scale poaching in their waters. However, better information-sharing and collective action can effectively focus limited naval resources to address the risk of large-scale IUU fishing and protect important sea-lanes.But there is more at play than fish in the great-power competition with China for the Pacific. For decades, a diplomatic contest between Taiwan and China has played out over flipping diplomatic recognition between the two. Militarily, America’s decades-long dominance of the Pacific is fading. Notable are Russian long-range bomber deployments, like that to Indonesia in December 2017, as well as repeated distant Chinese naval deployments. Such deployments by our adversaries make clear the Pacific is being contested and can no longer be considered an American lake.Today the South and Central Pacific includes critical sea and air lanes that support military operations in Asia, long assumed to be beyond any threat. This is no longer a viable military assumption, given Chinese and Russian long-range Pacific deployments, once again making the region of keen strategic importance.Given the paucity of U.S. naval presence and the associated inadequate capacity to patrol its own EEZ, the following actions are offered for consideration.Establish a Southern and Central Pacific Maritime Security Headquarters and Expand Support Infrastructure. To focus resources and enable better regional coordination, the U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area Command and Indo–Pacific Command should establish a detachment in American Samoa. This headquarters’ mission would be to identify and execute needed maritime training and infrastructure projects supporting a sustained maritime security presence, while synchronizing operational (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard’s Operation Blue PacificREF) and capacity-building activities with regional partners.In time, this could include attached units like military construction battalions (e.g., Navy Seabees and Army Corps of Engineers) and home-porting Coast Guard cutters. Additionally, this headquarters would coordinate episodic naval deployments by allies like Japan and the United Kingdom to the region. This will become important, given that the United Kingdom has deployed two patrol ships to the Pacific until 2026. They are expected to periodically operate in this region.REFConduct Annual Pacific QUAD Naval Exercises in the South and Central Pacific. The focus should be to practice wartime logistics, maritime patrol, convoy operations, and interdiction of large fishing fleets (e.g., the 2020 Galapagos Islands incident). The first iteration of this exercise should be coordinated to occur in conjunction with the establishment of the headquarters in American Samoa overseeing these exercises. Additionally, given Japan’s growing and welcome diplomatic footprint in the region, there may be value in announcing the launch of this exercise from one of its regional embassies. This could also be beneficial in highlighting the economic and policing aspects of these exercises throughout the region. Allowance should be made for future participation of Pacific island nation navies, notably from Fiji and Tonga.Standardize Maritime Policing Practices with Pacific Island Nations and Pacific QUAD Members. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been good use of virtual policing to enable a land-based third party to authorize maritime policing in its waters. This should be expanded and standardized so that, at a minimum, Pacific-QUAD members can support policing in all the participating nations’ EEZ.Create a Regionally Focused Maritime-Security-Capacity-Building Funding Account. For South and Central Pacific Island Nations, Congress should establish a security cooperation account like the Maritime Security Initiative of 2015.REF Likewise, to enable greater regional economic maritime development with military utility, the U.S. Secretary of Defense should identify ports and airfields to the Development Finance CorporationREF for favorable solicitation of investment proposals.The U.S. Coast Guard Should Increase Transparency on Its Fleet Needs by Updating Its Program of Record and Releasing a Report About the Degree of Risk It Is Accepting with Various Fleet Mixes. The lack of clear information on the Coast Guard’s fleet requirements makes it difficult for Congress to conduct effective oversight and for the public debate on new cutter acquisitions to be well-informed. Studies more than a decade old are still driving the debate—studies that do not take into account shifting mission demands and a dramatically changing global operating environment. In order to assist the Coast Guard to meet its missions, more information is required to inform the debate on the fleet.Develop Techniques for Countering Large-Scale IUU Fishing. Given the size of Chinese distant-waters fishing fleets, the U.S. Coast Guard’s training and techniques need to be developed and practiced to protect U.S. waters. These techniques must include countermeasures for dealing with Chinese maritime militia interspersed amidst large fishing fleets.Assess the Potential Value of Fishing and Implications of IUU Fishing in U.S. Waters. Congress should direct the U.S. Coast Guard, in concert with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide a report on the impact of illegal fishing on the U.S. fishing industry, impacts to local communities (e.g., American Samoa), and an update on the U.S. Coast Guard’s IUU Fishing Implementation Plan.Because of other operational requirements, today’s U.S. Navy is largely absent from the South and Central Pacific. Fortunately, the Coast Guard has not had to deal with large illegal Chinese fishing fleets in U.S. waters—yet. Nevertheless, the day when it will is fast approaching, and today it has limited ability to interdict such illicit maritime activity in U.S. Pacific EEZs. To fund the U.S. Coast Guard for this mission will take a different mindset, one that Congress, the Biden Administration, and the military need to realize and implement.Action is required to safeguard economic and security interests in this strategic region. Mobilizing the Pacific QUAD for maritime security is an important step until more Coast Guard cutters arrive. A visible and sustained maritime security presence in this region can deter IUU fishing while better securing critical sea and air lanes in the event of conflict in Asia.Moreover, the Coast Guard will be an important player in the nation’s strategic approach to China. The Coast Guard is, in fact, the best trained to take on peacetime competition in this region while building coalitions of like-minded nations. For too long, multiple Administrations have underappreciated and under-resourced the Coast Guard for its unavoidable role in great-power competition with China. This must change.Brent D.

            "title:  Putin’s Dangerous Nuclear Brinkmanship in Ukraine\n",
            "text Most Americans view nuclear weapons as a relic of the Cold War. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed in 1985 “that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.” That thinking has remained a “given” for the last 37 years. Unfortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin may have other ideas.Just five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin personally oversaw nuclear exercises and issued subtle nuclear threats against the West should Ukraine become a part of NATO. Once his war begun, the threats became less subtle. More recently, Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert. While the Pentagon reports it has not detected significant changes in Russia’s nuclear posture, Putin’s nuclear muscle flexing has prompted concern over how far he will go.A Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine—or worse, against a NATO state—is unlikely. Doing so would break a 75-year nuclear taboo while completely alienating the rest of the world from Russia. But the chances are not zero, either. The U.S. must take the threat seriously.>>> Russia Links Ukraine Sanctions to Iran Nuclear Talks to Shake Down Biden AdministrationWhen it comes to nuclear long-range missiles—those able to reach each other’s homelands—the U.S. and Russia have rough parity stemming from the New START arms control treaty. But Russia also has more than 2,000 low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons that are meant for use on a battlefield. In this category, Russia’s weapons outnumber the U.S. at least 10 to 1.The prevailing American view is that nuclear weapons should be used only for deterrence. But Russia’s official warfighting doctrine specifically reserves the right to use tactical nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict to compel the enemy to back down.Here’s where the nuclear danger comes in. If Russia continues to fail in its conventional military efforts to seize Ukrainian cities and topple the Ukrainian government, Putin might be tempted to fire a tactical nuclear weapon to compel Ukrainians to surrender and signal to the West that he will not take failure as an option.A nuclear attack on Ukraine, even with a very small nuclear weapon, would cause severe destruction and take thousands of lives if launched at a populated area. While NATO would not be obliged to respond militarily, such an attack would likely lead to further Russian isolation from the world and unite countries against Putin.A nuclear attack on a NATO state is less likely. Putin knows any nuclear attack will be met with a nuclear response. But short of launching a nuclear weapon at a NATO state, Putin may issue further nuclear threats against NATO intervention in Ukraine.Indeed, Putin’s order to move Russia’s nuclear weapons on higher alert was likely meant to scare away the West from getting involved. Or, if Ukraine continues to repel Russian forces, Putin may threaten nuclear attack to compel the West to stop sending military equipment to Ukraine.>>>What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWar against a major nuclear power—especially one that views nuclear weapons as “useable”—introduces complexities into the fight and forces the United States and its allies to proceed with caution. But by the same measure, NATO is a nuclear alliance, too. To deter nuclear war with Russia, NATO must be sure to communicate its resolve to use nuclear weapons if attacked.Moving forward, the United States must ensure that a strong nuclear deterrence is at the top of its agenda. After the Cold War, the United States retired thousands of nuclear weapons while letting its existing forces become older and older. Now, the U.S. is scrambling to replace its nuclear forces with modern systems before they age into obsolescence.Putin’s recent inflammatory rhetoric, nuclear saber-rattling and military actions in Ukraine are proof of the need for a strong, modern U.S. nuclear force. Indeed, the nuclear dangers in Ukraine have taught us that nuclear war is a 21st century concern. As much as U.S. policymakers might like to wish away nuclear weapons from existence, unfortunately, the enemy gets a vote.This piece originally appeared in MSN.com \n",

            "text In the latest in a series of specious and outlandish justifications for its illegal, immoral, and brutal invasion of sovereign Ukraine, Russia is claiming that Washington and Kyiv are working together to develop chemical and biological weapons.Pure Putin propaganda.Indeed, according to the U.S. State Department this week:The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine, it is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention, and it does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.On the other hand, the State Department notes:It is Russia that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological Weapons Convention.No surprises in that State Department claim, considering that Russian operatives have used the Novichok nerve agent to attack former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and Russian political dissident Alexei Navalny in recent years.Russia has also shamelessly supported the regime of Syria’s Bashar Assad, which has used a variety of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in the brutal civil war there. With the war in Ukraine in a stalemate that includes significant losses for the Russian forces in the face of stiff Ukrainian political and military resistance, Russia is looking for ways to reenergize its political and military campaign to subjugate Ukraine.To do this, Moscow might develop a “false flag” operation, involving the use of chemical (or less likely biological) weapons in Ukraine against Russian forces, ethnic Russians in Ukraine, or even Ukrainian civilians.The attack could possibly be choreographed to look like it was supposedly executed by Ukrainian forces.An even more elaborate Russian operation might try to finger U.S. or NATO forces, rather than Ukrainian forces, as being the perpetrators of such a heinous act, which would almost assuredly include examples of those supposedly killed by the weapons.Such a contrived act would likely take place on Ukrainian territory currently controlled by Russian forces, such as the eastern Ukrainian region of the Donbas. The false flag operation could be used to “change the channel” on Russian brutality in Ukraine in the international information space. Indeed, the Chinese are reportedly parroting this Russian propaganda about weapons labs. A false flag operation could also be used to burnish the image of the Russian armed forces at home, where the Russian people are being fed a steady diet of propaganda about the Ukraine invasion.Even more troubling, the false flag operation could be used to justify an escalation in the use of force and violence in Ukraine.Based on Biden administration statements, likely supported by U.S. and other intelligence, the Kremlin would use any trick in the book to justify its unjustifiable war in Ukraine—including the use of weapons of mass destruction.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including the United States, rests on the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Russia’s ongoing war of naked aggression against Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which threat should be the focus of NATO’s upcoming strategic concept.The answer is clear: The U.S. must lead the Alliance to a wholesale refocusing on the organization’s raison d’être of collective defense. While the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the fact remains that Russia continues to be the only existential threat to member states. NATO must send a strong signal that it is strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to the increased threat from Russia.Deterrence measures should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to defense spending; a persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern European member states; updated Alliance operational planning in light of Russia’s position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S. air, ground, and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of continued commitment to the NATO treaty’s Article 5.These deterrence measures must be carried out with the recognition that, from a long-term perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from whom the U.S. must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S. force posture must not be to the detriment of the nation’s ability to counter China.From the Arctic to the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable threat to NATO and the interests of its members. For member states in Eastern Europe, Russia represents a real and potentially existential threat. Russia’s entrenched position in Belarus, along with its ongoing actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members, in two, scramble the geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to NATO operational planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its eastern flank.Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine will hopefully be the push that some allies need to finally live up to their commitments to the NATO defense spending benchmark. As an intergovernmental security alliance, NATO is only as strong as its member states. Weak defense spending on the continent has led to a significant loss of capabilities and embarrassing gaps in readiness for NATO allies. As a result, American Presidents of both political parties have long called for increases in defense spending by NATO allies.Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty—an attack on one is an attack on all—Article 3 is the most important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3 states that member states, at a minimum, will “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.” Only a handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to their Article 3 commitment.In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense investment, NATO set a target for its 30 member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales Summit, member states recommitted to spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and committed to spending 20 percent of their defense budgets on “major equipment” purchases by 2024.NATO allies have made real and sustained increases in defense spending in recent years, but it is far from enough. In 2021, 10 members of the Alliance spent 2 percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20 percent benchmark.REF Procuring capabilities does not happen overnight, and allies in NATO must commit today to investing the necessary political and economic capital to fulfill their Article 3 treaty commitments.U.S. basing structures in Europe harken back to a time when Denmark, West Germany, and Greece represented the front lines of freedom. The security situation in Europe has changed, not least of which due to Russia’s force posture in Belarus and occupied portions of Ukraine. The U.S. must account for this shift by establishing a persistent and continuing military presence in allied nations further east. A robust presence displays the long-term U.S. resolve to live up to its NATO treaty commitments. The U.S. should lead by example, while also encouraging other NATO allies to base forces in Eastern European member states.Over the course of the past few weeks, the U.S. has deployed additional rotational forces in Europe. On Thursday, 7,000 troops from the Army’s First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, deployed to bases in Germany.REF In total, the U.S. has deployed an additional 14,000 troops to Europe in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has also redeployed aircraft further east on a temporary basis, including 20 Apache helicopters (AH-64s) based in Germany deploying to Baltic allies, 12 AH-64s based in Greece deploying to Poland,REF and six F-35 fighter jets from Utah deploying temporarily to bases in Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania.REF Furthermore, two B-52s from the 5th Bomb Wing deployed on a “long-planned Bomber Task Force Europe mission over the Arctic and Baltic Sea regions.”REFEarlier in February, the U.S. deployed 3,000 forces to Poland and Romania to bolster deterrence and aid in preparations for refugees crossing the border from Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that “[t]hese moves are temporary in nature, and are part of the more than 90,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent orders.”Some NATO allies have also increased their presence further east. Germany, which serves as the framework nation in Lithuania for NATO’s enhanced forward presence battalion stationed there, added 350 troops.REF NATO allies have battlegroups stationed in Estonia (U.K.-led), Latvia (Canadian-led), and Poland (U.S.-led); France has offered to lead a similar battalion in Romania, and stated that it is “accelerating” the deployment of forces to the nation.REF On Friday, NATO activated its Very High Readiness Joint Taskforce (VJTF), with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: “We are now deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of collective defense.”REF NATO will partially deploy a portion of the VJTF to Eastern Europe; the deployment will include air, land, and naval assets.REFRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine highlights the stark reality that the threat from Russia to NATO is real and enduring. The U.S. and its allies must take immediate steps to bolster collective defense and deter Vladimir Putin from aggression against a NATO member state. In light of the emerging new security reality on the continent, the U.S. should:Russia’s ongoing violation of the sovereignty of Ukraine highlights the importance of NATO and its Article 5 guarantee, as well as the need for a united and robust Alliance posture in Eastern Europe. Both are necessary for sending a clear message to Russia to deter Putin from violating the sovereignty of a NATO member.Daniel Kochis is Senior Policy Analyst in European Affairs in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.

            "text Since 2002, the United States Air Force has been on a fitful path to recapitalization of its fleet of air refueling aircraft, which now average 55 years old.REF In an effort to save money, it has reduced its fleet size by retiring aging tankers without suitable replacements. It also has based its future tanker capacity requirements on regional rather than peer-level threats. As it continues to wrestle with a replacement tanker that has experienced considerable delays, the service should:The Air Force began a process to replace its fleet of KC-135 and KC-10 tankers in 2001 with a controversial sole-source proposal that involved both buying and leasing new aircraft from the Boeing Corporation. That program was terminated in 2005 after corruption related to Boeing’s lease proposal was uncovered.REFFollowing that inauspicious start, in 2006, the Air Force issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a highly capable, medium-sized, low-risk, and low-cost tanker to replace the oldest KC-135s in the inventory.REF The two vendors that submitted proposals were the Boeing Corporation and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus at the time, in partnership with Northrup-Grumman. EADS won the contract, but shortly after the award, Boeing filed a formal protest.REF Many in Congress voiced their concerns to the Office of the Secretary of Defense about the award of a major weapons system to a foreign company,REF and in 2008, Secretary Robert Gates terminated the program.REF After a cooling-off period, the Air Force revised the requirements and requested a new set of proposals for its next tanker.The cost of Boeing’s submission in that round of competition reportedly was less than the cost of the EADS submission, and in 2011, the Air Force awarded Boeing a contract to modify its already successful 767 airliner into the KC-46A air refueling platform and deliver a total of 179 tankers in a program that would become known as KC-X.REF The first seven jets were to be delivered in 2015; 18 were to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) by August 2017;REF and the last six were to be acquired in 2027.REFOver the years, the initiative to replace the tanker fleet has morphed into three incremental acquisition programs known as KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z. KC-X acquisition will be completed with the last KC-46A delivery; KC-Y, also known as the Bridge Tanker, was initially intended to replace the KC-10s and a tranche of older KC-135s beginning in 2029; and the KC-Z will replace the remaining KC-135s at some point in the future.REFThe KC-X program has suffered several technical and production challenges, and the Air Force is now on track to accept the last of the KC-46s in 2029 after a three-year delay. To continue the seamless replacement of its aging tankers, the service intends to solicit proposals for KC-Y by the end of 2022 with the intent of receiving the first of as many as 160 tankers in 2029.REFThe KC-46 was designed to refuel both Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps aircraft, and the difference between these two systems are significant.Air Force tanker booms can be configured to fly with a drogue/basket (only) to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, or they can fly with two additional drogue/basket pods mounted on the wings, allowing the tanker to refuel either type of aircraft on the same mission. C-130s can be configured with drogue/basket systems to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, but their offload capacity is much lower because the airframe is smaller and therefore carries less fuel.For the purposes of this paper, C-130s are referred to as tactical air refueling systems, and KC-135, KC-10, KC-46, and KC-Y systems are referred to as strategic air refueling systems/tankers. Before the service begins the selection process for the KC-Y, it is important that the status of the KC-X program and the challenges that have characterized deliveries of the KC-46A be understood.To date, more than 60 KC-46s have been delivered, but even at the most basic level, the program has been marred by a string of system design problems and production faults. The KC-46 design incorporated the concept for a Remote Vision System (RVS) that molds video from multiple cameras at the rear of the plane to create a two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) vision system, allowing the boom operator to sit in the main cabin and refuel the aircraft remotely.During flight testing in 2016 and 2017, aircrew identified several major issues with the RVS and the aircraft’s refueling boom that inhibit the KC-46A from executing its primary mission: refueling other aircraft.REF The jet’s boom was too stiff, which proved to be problematic for fueling lighter aircraft like A-10s and F-16s.REF Problems surrounding the RVS were first reported as issues surrounding a “sunlight glare” during certain times of the day, but the challenge is much deeper.The RVS 2D/3D, black-and-white cameras are mounted at the rear of the KC-46, just behind the aircraft’s boom. While the camera image can wash out during certain sun angles, even when paired with the jet’s 3D goggles, the system does not give boomers the depth perception they need to conduct normal air refueling operations. Stunningly, the system often fails to capture or display the length of the telescopic boom as it extends to make contact with receiver aircraft.REFThe alignment of the RVS cameras in relation to the air refueling boom’s outer tubeREF effectively obscures or masks the last several feet of the telescoping portion of the boom,REF including the refueling probe that makes contact with the refueling receptacles of receiver aircraft.REF If the lighting/sun angle is right, the system can pick up the end of the boom’s shadow on top of the receiving aircraft. This work-around gives boomers the opportunity to gauge the position of the tip of the boom before attempting to connect to receiving aircraft. However, it also assumes the best of conditions, and when viewed in context with current refueling procedures, its associated challenges become glaringly obvious.The refueling receptacle for the F-16 is located several feet behind the cockpit and is not visible to pilots flying those single-seat fighters. Refueling procedures for the F-16 call for the pilots to fly to a position directly in line with the end of the tanker’s boom and then move forward directly toward the end of the probe. As the distance between the end of the boom and the jet’s canopy closes, the boomer uses his depth perception to judge when to move the boom around and then directly behind the F-16’s canopy to make contact with the jet’s refueling receptacle. With questionable depth perception, no reliable ability to see the end of the boom, and no usable surface area in front of the canopy to catch the boom’s shadow, attempting to refuel an F-16 with the KC-46’s RVS system during daytime in clear weather conditions is challenging.In addition, during heavy weather or clear-air turbulence, the tanker and receiver aircraft can move up and down rapidly without warning, often in opposing cycles. Attempting to make a refueling connection without relevant depth perception and without being able to see the end of the boom under those conditions elevates what would otherwise be a benign procedure to one that is mishap-prone, even with the most experienced boomers.While the technical challenges with the boom and RVS are troubling, issues with basic workmanship are equally illuminating. In February 2019, an internal Boeing management memo noted that Air Force pilots were finding so much debris and so many loose tools throughout brand-new jets that “they will not fly [them] due to the FOD (foreign object debris) issues and the current [lack of] confidence they have in our product….”REFBoeing was able to win the KC-X contract primarily because it met three criteria: cost, preservation of the U.S. industrial base for tankers, and previous experience in building the KC-135. While noble in design, all three criteria have delivered poor outcomes for the KC-X acquisition program.Boeing reportedly underbid EADS in a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract that made it financially responsible for cost overruns. To date, the company has absorbed some $5.4 billion in cost overrunsREF that otherwise would have been borne by the government through a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.FFP contracts work well for proven systems or for those with very high technology readiness levels (TRLs), but the design for the KC-46’s RVS system met neither of those criteria. On the surface, Boeing’s FFP contract for the KC-X effectively limited a great deal of financial risk to the government, but it also has caused a significant amount of operational risk. Forcing or even allowing a contractor to insert a low-TRL system under such an agreement can put contractors in dire financial straits, and the collateral effects within this effort have exposed the government to operational risks with enormous attendant costs.Eleven years after the KC-X contract was awarded, the Air Force is accepting aircraft that are years away from having a viable operational capability, and the program remains anything but low risk. The new tanker is prohibited from supporting real-world contingency operations, and the jet’s initial operating capability (IOC) date has slipped to fiscal year (FY) 2024 at the earliest.REF By that time, the Air Force will have taken possession of some 103 KC-46s.REFThe Air Force estimates that the fix for the boom and RVS should be ready by the spring of 2024,REF but the shortcuts the service is taking to make that timeline are eye-opening. The problems with the current system were discovered during flight testing, yet the Air Force has decided not to assess or flight test the fully revised RVS before it accepts the design.REF Problems discovered beyond that point could result in even more significant delays, and the costs for fixing the system will be borne by the Air Force.Assuming the redesign goes as planned, retrofitting jets that the service has already accepted with the boom and RVS redesign will take several years, and the operational impact of that process will be significant: 103 strategic air refueling assets will be unusable in real-world operations in 2024. That number will grow to 110 jets in 2025, equating to 23 percent of the fleet that will be unable to fulfill operational taskings. Assuming that the design and retrofit stay on track, the numbers will slowly start to improve through 2029 when all KC-46s will be fully operational.REFRecognizing the gap in operational capability, Congress, through the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), directed the Air Force to slow or curtail the retirement of viable tanker aircraft until the KC-46 comes up to speed.REF Unfortunately, that move has introduced still other challenges. As the service continues to accept new KC-46s, the squadrons and crews that transition to those jets are no longer available to fly the operationally capable KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The Air Force is studying methods for filling those cockpits and covering the operational gapsREF by hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is retiring. However, while this option may buy down operational risk, it will undoubtedly impose a significant financial burden on the Air Force.Because crews that transition to the KC-46 need to continue training, the service moved last year to meet that need as well as to relieve KC-10 and KC-135 operational tempo where possible. The Air Force approved the KC-46A for stateside operations and refueling missions in support of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM); for aircraft that employ probe/drogue refueling (Navy/Marine Corps fighters); and for 11 Air Force platforms.REF The list does not include the F-35, F-22, or B-2 because of the likelihood of the KC-46 RVS/boom system’s errantly damaging the stealth coatings on those jets. Commanders may elect to waive that restriction during contingency or wartime operations, but they will have to accept the increased operational risk.Boeing is at least seven years away from delivering 179 fully operational KC-46s, and risks to the service and its wartime mission between now and 2029 will be significant. It is important to keep those lessons in mind as the Air Force moves to acquire the next increment of tankers, particularly in light of recent events and the possibility that they might escalate into great-power conflict. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced even the most dovish nations within NATO to revise their defense spending to ready their nations for a possible conflict with Russia,REF and the Commander of Indo-Pacific Command has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that China could move on Taiwan by 2027.REF The potential for great-power conflict is growing, and the United States needs to acquire the capacity to fight such a war.Later this year, the Air Force will release an RFP for the next increment of 150 strategic tankers. Both the Boeing Corporation and Lockheed Martin/Airbus are expected to submit proposals that are designed to capture the KC-Y contract. Boeing is expected to offer the KC-46A that is currently in production in the United States. The Airbus/Lockheed Martin KC-Y proposal, named the Lockheed Martin Next Generation Tanker or LMXT, will be a modified version of Airbus’s A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).The MRTT is already operational and has been certified to refuel every fighter aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and Navy inventories. It has a boom enhanced vision system (BEVS) with 3D, high-definition color displays that allow boomers to sit in the main cabin and remotely refuel other aircraft. BEVS was designed to enable automated air refueling (refueling without a boom operator) using machine vision algorithms. That sub-system is on track to be certified for automatic daytime refueling later in 2022 and nighttime refueling in 2023. Based on the Airbus A-330 airliner, the MRTT design will be modified to increase its fuel capacity.Both the KC-46 and the LMXT have cargoREF and passenger carriage capabilities and are designed to accept high-end command and control equipment to further the Air Battle Management System/Joint Air Domain Command and Control network efforts. However, those capabilities are secondary to the air refueling mission, and the RFP and follow-on acquisition decision process must prioritize those capabilities accordingly.While the overarching tanker acquisition strategy has morphed over the years, the KC-Y Bridge Tanker program was initially designed to replace the KC-10, a jet that can carry significantly more fuel than the KC-135 carries. The distances and fuel offload capacity required to establish a tanker bridge and sustain operations from the United States to the area of operations would be much greater in a peer fight with China than they would be in a fight with Russia. That fact, coupled with China’s intent to target any tanker base within range of its air-to-surface missile systems, makes fuel offload capacity at range a critical capability. The KC-10 carries a maximum of 356,000 pounds of fuel, which is 70 percent more than either the KC-135 or KC-46 can carry, but it burns fuel at a much higher rate than the KC-135, KC46, or LMXT. The KC-135 has a capacity of 200,000 pounds, and the KC-46 can carry 211,000 pounds,REF but the LMXT can carry 268,445 pounds.REFThe operational effects of that additional capacity are not insignificant. In real terms, the LMXT could refuel seven more F-35s than the KC-46 can refuel when the offload point (Air Refueling Contact Point or ARCP) is 1,000 miles from the tanker’s launch and recovery base, six more at an operating radius of 2,000 miles, and five more at 3,000 miles. The LMXT and KC-10 can offload the same amount of fuel at 2,500 miles, but from that point on, because of its more efficient engines, the LMXT can offload more than even the KC-10 is able to offload.REFThe LMXT’s increased capacity and proven track record make it a viable contender in this competition. Because the KC-46 is smaller than the LMXT, it conceivably could operate out of more bases in the Pacific region when both aircraft are loaded to their maximum gross weights. When both aircraft are loaded to the same gross weights, however, the LMXT can fly out of more airfields because of its more powerful engines. Assuming that the issues with its boom and RVS are resolved in due course, the KC-46 will be a serious contender, but it will take years for those issues to be resolved, and acquiring an additional 150 Pegasus platforms before the fix has been accepted would therefore be unwise. Delaying the KC-Y acquisition decision until the KC-46 becomes operational is an option, but such a delay would levy even more risk on an already strained tanker fleet.Pressure from Members of Congress and industrial partners to embrace that risk and fall back on the same cost savings and buy-American criteria that got the service in trouble with the KC-X program will undoubtedly be high. Both sticker price and preservation of an organic American industrial base for tankers are important considerations, but as previously noted, the costs associated with filling the operational gaps created by the KC-46 RVS and boom issues are likewise important. Perhaps as a sign that Airbus/Lockheed Martin learned from their previous proposal, they now have plans to assemble the A-330 airframe in Mobile, Alabama, and modify it into the LMXT tanker in Marietta, Georgia.Finally, the critical technology within the LMXT proposal is already operational and at work in dozens of fielded MRTT platforms, which means the risk associated with acquiring this system would be minimal. The Bridge Tanker acquisition decision is a critical one, and it will be important for the service to go through the acquisition process by the book and avoid the gaffes and resets that it suffered with the KC-X in the mid-2000s. The service needs as many operational booms as it can field for a possible fight with China—even more capacity than it currently is programmed to acquire.By the end of the KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z acquisition programs, the Air Force will have replaced all KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft with new and more capable tankers while reducing the total number of strategic refueling platforms from 479 to 457. That number is woefully insufficient for a peer fight, based on the recent history of real-world operations as well as formal tanker requirement studies.In both 1991 and 2003, the Air Force possessed some 600 KC-135 and KC-10 tankers.REF When the service executed Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, it employed some 271 tankers to support the airbridge to the Persian Gulf as well as combat operations in Iraq.REF Twelve years later, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the demand for Air Force tankers peaked at 319 and then leveled off to a continual demand of 280 (95 airbridge and 185 combat support)—a number that did not include tankers from sister services or allies.REFWith today’s inventory of 479 aircraft, that daily tanker support requirement for a regional war against a Third World adversary would consume 58 percent of our current fleet, and that number does not include combat losses, tankers required to defend the homeland or support deterrence operations in a second theater, or tankers held in reserve to support nuclear strike operations. According to a recent Hudson Institute study, this could mean an additional 325 tankers,REF which, when combined with the sustained Operation Iraqi Freedom requirement of 280 tankers, equates to a capacity requirement of 605 strategic air refueling aircraft.While those numbers are significant, the airbridge and combat support requirements for a peer fight, particularly one conducted in the threat environment and over the vast distances associated with a fight with China, would likely dwarf that number. A U.S. Department of Defense Study completed in 2001 concluded that “500–600 KC-135R equivalents” were needed “to meet the National Military Strategy,” and a 2005 Mobility Capabilities Study “reportedly recommended the acquisition of 520–640 KC-135R model equivalents.”REF Both of those studies were conducted long before the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) directed the services to prepare for great-power competition with China or Russia.REFSeven months after the 2018 NDS was released, the Secretary of the Air Force released “The Air Force We Need,” a study examining the capacity the service would need to support that strategy. Based on thousands of war-game simulations, the study found that the service would need 14 more tanker squadrons than the 40 it had at the time,REF which equates to a total of 691 strategic refueling platforms.REFAlthough the service has backed away from the study because of the associated cost, it remains the most accurate estimate we have for the tanker requirements associated with great-power competition. Other alliances with other nations may bring additional fighter capacity to such a fight, but almost every nation will need the strategic tanker support that only the Air Force can bring.The Air Force should increase its capacity requirement to match the approximately 691 tankers recommended in “The Air Force We Need,” and now is an excellent time to begin. As previously noted, the Air Force is studying methods for covering the operational gaps caused by delays associated with the KC-46. One option would be to shift “retiring” active-duty air refueling assets to the Reserve Component. This would undoubtedly be less expensive than a commercial option, and the assets and crews would have no geographic constraint on where they could fly in times of war.Hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is moving to retire might also be a viable option. While constraints on where those leased platforms could fly would be an issue, the option would allow the service to build the 691-tanker capacity requirement for a peer fight, satisfy congressional concerns, and allow the service to continue or even accelerate its programmed retirements of the KC-10 and KC-135 tanker fleets.REFCongress should:For its part, the Air Force should:The Air Force should move immediately to strengthen the path to recapitalization of its fleet of strategic air refueling aircraft through seamless competition, both to incentivize performance within and to expand the tanker industrial base. The Defense Department should maintain the current proposal and acquisition schedule for the KC-Y, and the award should prioritize proven performance and the minimization of risk. The retirement of viable tanker aircraft fleet should end until operational replacements are in place, and the Air Force should increase its air refueling capacity from 479 to 691 owned or leased tankers to ensure that it is better prepared for possible conflict with a peer competitor.John Venable is Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy in the Center for National Defense, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.\n",

            "title:  Putin’s Dangerous Nuclear Brinkmanship in Ukraine\n",
            "text Most Americans view nuclear weapons as a relic of the Cold War. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed in 1985 “that a nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.” That thinking has remained a “given” for the last 37 years. Unfortunately, Russian President Vladimir Putin may have other ideas.Just five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin personally oversaw nuclear exercises and issued subtle nuclear threats against the West should Ukraine become a part of NATO. Once his war begun, the threats became less subtle. More recently, Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert. While the Pentagon reports it has not detected significant changes in Russia’s nuclear posture, Putin’s nuclear muscle flexing has prompted concern over how far he will go.A Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine—or worse, against a NATO state—is unlikely. Doing so would break a 75-year nuclear taboo while completely alienating the rest of the world from Russia. But the chances are not zero, either. The U.S. must take the threat seriously.>>> Russia Links Ukraine Sanctions to Iran Nuclear Talks to Shake Down Biden AdministrationWhen it comes to nuclear long-range missiles—those able to reach each other’s homelands—the U.S. and Russia have rough parity stemming from the New START arms control treaty. But Russia also has more than 2,000 low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons that are meant for use on a battlefield. In this category, Russia’s weapons outnumber the U.S. at least 10 to 1.The prevailing American view is that nuclear weapons should be used only for deterrence. But Russia’s official warfighting doctrine specifically reserves the right to use tactical nuclear weapons in a conventional conflict to compel the enemy to back down.Here’s where the nuclear danger comes in. If Russia continues to fail in its conventional military efforts to seize Ukrainian cities and topple the Ukrainian government, Putin might be tempted to fire a tactical nuclear weapon to compel Ukrainians to surrender and signal to the West that he will not take failure as an option.A nuclear attack on Ukraine, even with a very small nuclear weapon, would cause severe destruction and take thousands of lives if launched at a populated area. While NATO would not be obliged to respond militarily, such an attack would likely lead to further Russian isolation from the world and unite countries against Putin.A nuclear attack on a NATO state is less likely. Putin knows any nuclear attack will be met with a nuclear response. But short of launching a nuclear weapon at a NATO state, Putin may issue further nuclear threats against NATO intervention in Ukraine.Indeed, Putin’s order to move Russia’s nuclear weapons on higher alert was likely meant to scare away the West from getting involved. Or, if Ukraine continues to repel Russian forces, Putin may threaten nuclear attack to compel the West to stop sending military equipment to Ukraine.>>>What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWar against a major nuclear power—especially one that views nuclear weapons as “useable”—introduces complexities into the fight and forces the United States and its allies to proceed with caution. But by the same measure, NATO is a nuclear alliance, too. To deter nuclear war with Russia, NATO must be sure to communicate its resolve to use nuclear weapons if attacked.Moving forward, the United States must ensure that a strong nuclear deterrence is at the top of its agenda. After the Cold War, the United States retired thousands of nuclear weapons while letting its existing forces become older and older. Now, the U.S. is scrambling to replace its nuclear forces with modern systems before they age into obsolescence.Putin’s recent inflammatory rhetoric, nuclear saber-rattling and military actions in Ukraine are proof of the need for a strong, modern U.S. nuclear force. Indeed, the nuclear dangers in Ukraine have taught us that nuclear war is a 21st century concern. As much as U.S. policymakers might like to wish away nuclear weapons from existence, unfortunately, the enemy gets a vote.This piece originally appeared in MSN.com \n",

            "title:  What’s Driving Up Gas Prices—And Why the White House Won’t Help\n",
            "text When a news anchor confronted Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm about high gasoline prices and asked about the Biden administration’s plan to increase oil production in America, she burst into laughter. “That is hilarious,” she said.It was early November 2021, and gas prices were averaging $3.39 nationally. The reporter wasn’t laughing. And now, with the average price well above $4 and still climbing, no one else is either.Americans feel the pressure build every time they fill up, of course, but it doesn’t stop there. Think of all the activities, goods and services that rely on transportation, and one starts to see how higher gasoline prices increase costs throughout the entire economy.What, many are asking, is going on? And what can be done?>>> Russian Oil Import Ban Just a Distraction From Biden’s Anti-Energy Policies Crude oil prices account for roughly half the price of a gallon of gas, followed by refining costs, distribution, and state and local taxes. Unpacking each shows where policy choices influence the price of gasoline.Start with the last, most straightforward factor first.State and local taxes, most often used to fund transportation infrastructure, explain some significant differences between the price of gasoline between states. While taxes and fees in Nevada average roughly 20 cents per gallon, neighboring California’s tally 50 cents or more because of the state’s punishing climate policies that are designed to discourage people from driving.Distribution—the delivery of gasoline to the customer—is a relatively stable contributor into the price of a gallon. But even here, policy matters. For example, federal law severely restricts the ships available to deliver energy domestically, which actually makes it cheaper for some states to import fuel from Russia than from Texas. This is especially true for coastal states with limited pipeline capacity (yet another policy choice).Then there’s refining, the process that turns oil into usable fuel. Prices increase every summer, when the EPA requires refineries to switch over to more expensive blends of gasoline to comply with Clean Air Act standards. Some states also mandate that refineries make boutique blends of gasoline, forcing customers to pay a green premium. Refinery expenses have also been increasing, as costs to comply with the EPA’s renewable fuel mandate are at record highs.Last, and certainly not least, is crude oil, which provides 90 percent of Americans’ transportation fuel needs. Gasoline prices tend to follow the price of crude oil closely, and everything else being equal, Americans see an increase of 2.4 cents per gallon every time the price of a barrel of crude oil increases by $1. Since oil is a globally traded commodity, the U.S. can’t set the price of oil. But domestic production—and the policies that allow or prevent that from happening—can influence it.The world is now experiencing crude oil prices well over $100 per barrel—prices not seen since 2014. The best way to decrease oil prices—and, given the current context, dilute Russia’s sway in energy markets—is to increase supply. Yet President Joe Biden is unwilling to make the policy changes that would allow this to happen.Biden remains adamant that the solution isn’t to use all the energy resources we have, but to force a transition to a narrow set of politically preferred technologies. So while asking American oil companies for short-term production increases to bail him out of political trouble, Biden has made it clear that he intends to put them out of business in the long term.>>> U.S. Is World’s Largest Oil and Natural Gas Producer—Despite Biden’s Energy-Constraining PoliciesTo that end, the administration’s regulatory agenda aims to choke energy supply. Even now, with Americans struggling, they want to make it more expensive and difficult to explore for and produce oil, construct and operate pipelines, and access financing and investment. And that means they have to manipulate customer demand by discouraging gasoline use in the long run.The only reason American families and businesses are not hurting more than they already are, is because energy production is happening primarily on state and private lands, putting it a little further out of reach of Biden’s anti-energy agenda. For now.In the same month of Granholm’s disastrous interview, White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki was asked whether the administration’s policies contributed to gasoline prices, to which she responded with surprising honesty: “The rise in gas prices over the long term makes an even stronger case for doubling down our investment and our focus on clean energy options.”In other words: High prices are a feature, not a bug, of this administration’s policies.This piece originally appeared in Newsday\n",

            "text Red Hill has been leaking for years due to crumbling infrastructure. Yet the problem at this important Navy underground fuel storage facility in Hawaii went unaddressed for years. Now, it threatens the island’s major aquifer, forcing the government’s hand. Sadly, the government has reacted in a typical knee-jerk fashion. We must do better to deal with all the dangers involved. The facility now poses a serious health risk. But there is more at stake than drinking water. Red Hill plays a critical part in meeting the logistic needs of the Navy. It is where we store the fuels that keep the Pacific Fleet sailing. This critical military asset looms even more important as war rages in Europe and tensions with China grow. The nation needs a smart solution that addresses the health concerns of those living on the island without endangering national security. >>> How the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023 Should Prepare the Military for Great-Power CompetitionBuilt in 1943, Red Hill today is surrounded by family housing. Two major leaks occurred last year, threatening to contaminate the island’s main aquifer. They were by no means the first leaks. Concerns with Red Hill contaminating drinking water date back to at least 2002, when groundwater monitoring was begun.The latest leaks, however, galvanized local leaders to demand action. On March 7th, they got it. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered that the World War II era facility be emptied and abandoned within a year. He set a May 31 deadline for coming up with a plan that would assure the safety of Hawaii’s drinking water without jeopardizing the fleet’s ability to serve its vital security mission. The Defense Department has released a fact sheet giving some clues on what this plan may look like. The key appears to be distributing fuel storage among various commercial sites (assumed to be in Hawaii) and tankers.Tankers can provide a viable and mobile option, but their use raises several questions. Where will the tankers load and where will they transfer fuel to the warships? Will these tankers be newly acquired and crewed or drawn from an already inadequate fleet of commercial ready reserve vessels? >>> The Biden Administration Needs To Get Serious About National DefenseLots of details need to be worked out to ensure the Navy remains ready amidst a rapidly worsening security environment. It seems quite doubtful that relying on tankers alone can address the logistic needs of the Pacific Fleet. Moreover, the fact sheet did not address the need for secure drinking water in Hawaii.And therein lies the problem. We have set a deadline for closing Red Hill without conditioning that on having a viable and proven alternative in place. That is dangerous. A more prudent course of action would have been to set a deadline for providing an alternative water source in Hawaii and a Red Hill replacement. Congress and the Department of Defense both bear responsibility for neglecting military infrastructure for decades. Now, they must act. But they need not—and must not--act rashly.This piece originally appeared in RealClearDefense \n",

            "text The Chinese Communist Party announced this week it will increase the budget for the People’s Liberation Army by 7.1%.The announcement occurred at the opening session of the National People’s Congress—the annual rubber-stamp parliament. Thus, it is just a matter of time before the extra resources start following to the People’s Liberation Army.This increase continues the trend of sustained increases in the Chinese military budget. Since 2018, the Chinese Communist Party has increased the People’s Liberation Army budget by over 28% with consecutive annual increases of between 8.1% and 6.6%.Contrast this with the U.S. defense budget, which grew little under 5% from 2018 to 2021. However, if you take inflation into account, the U.S. defense budget decreased by 3% in those four years.One of the party’s favorite propaganda vehicles, the Global Times, reported that “the proposed defense budget would mark the single-digit growth for seven consecutive years since 2016 and also a return to a 7-plus percent increase.”The return to an above 7% increase comes after successive years of double-digit growth, ranging from 10.7% to 13% in the earlier part of the 2010s. Further, the People’s Liberation Army is able to get more bang for its buck. As just one example, the Chinese labor costs are substantially lower than American labor costs, enabling them to field a bigger force while spending less.Additionally, China can impose its defense costs on its state-owned companies, shielding the People’s Liberation Army budget from these expenses.By any measure, the Chinese Communist Party has been steadily modernizing and investing in its armed forces with the overall goal of having a fully mechanized and informatized military by 2027.This is an assessment shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in its recently released annual threat assessment, which stated that “Beijing is accelerating the development of key capabilities it believes the People’s Liberation Army’s needs to confront the United States in a large-scale, sustained conflict.”The assessment further elaborates that “China will continue pursuing its goal of building a world-class military that will enable it to secure what it views as its sovereign territory, establish its preeminence in regional affairs, and project power globally while offsetting perceived U.S. military superiority.” Clearly the Intelligence Community believes that the Chinese Communist Party has the will to leverage brute force to impose its ideology, as exemplified by its brutal crackdown in Hong Kong.Today we are watching what an undeterred authoritarian power is capable of doing to subjugate its democratic neighbor in Ukraine, as Russian troops destroy cities and target civilian populations indiscriminately.The United States and the world will be paying close attention to the lessons that Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party leadership will derive from the Western response to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine. The Chinese Communist Party is investing in building the capabilities it would need to subjugate and dominate its neighbors.One of the lessons to be learned is that dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin are only deterred by the prospect of a strong military response from determined allies. If we hope to deter China from similarly coercing its neighbors, a strong and capable U.S. military will be necessary.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text The U.S. is engaged in a strategic competition with China across the political, economic, and military spectrum, and maritime security and resource protection is an important but often overlooked aspect of this competition. As recent events make evident, the potential incursion of a large Chinese fishing fleet protected by paramilitary units into U.S. waters is here. The challenge is such that any response must act in concert with Pacific allies to secure significant U.S. economic, military, and ecological interests. The threat is greatest in U.S. waters of the South and Central Pacific, where prompt action is most needed.This response will require improved maritime policing, defense, and improvement of associated infrastructure, especially in the lightly patrolled South and Central Pacific. Improving the posture of the U.S. Coast Guard and dedicating platforms and resources to the existing security coordinating body—the Pacific Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), consisting of Australia, France, New Zealand, and the U.S.—can achieve some early results economically, but is only a start to addressing the larger challenge.  In July 2020, over 300 Chinese fishing vessels gathered around—and sometimes in—the protected waters of Ecuador’s Galapagos Islands. At the time, the potential loss of endangered species in the Galapagos Marine Reserve and blighting of a UNESCO World Heritage site enraged many with a conservationist bent. Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno saw also potential economic loss, and it was enough for him to seek multinational action.REF However, China’s global industrial fishing fleet is not just Ecuador’s problem, but a U.S. one as well.In an arc stretching over 1,400 miles from Wake Island to Johnston Atoll and south 1,900 miles to American Samoa are six U.S. exclusive economic zones (EEZ), rich in fish and untapped natural resources. To protect the coral reefs and associated biodiversity, four Pacific marine national monuments were established by President George W. Bush in 2009.REFIn this arc are two marine national monuments, the Pacific Remote Islands (495,189 square miles), and Rose Atoll (13,436 square miles).REF Without improved U.S. maritime capacity and allied coordination these U.S. maritime rights are at risk. However, it is far from just about fish: Should a conflict erupt in Asia, the U.S. will rely on secure shipping and air freight across the region to support military operations.China’s fishing fleets are globally significant both economically and ecologically. Since 2011, China’s appetite for seafood has driven imports—tripling to $15 billion in 2019 and pushing its fishing fleets further afield. Today they make up 38 percent of all global fishing activity.REFEcological. The ecological impacts are evident: Chinese “dark” fishing fleets have surged into the Sea of Japan to catch squid, which, since 2003, have faced significant population declines.REF Chinese distant fishing fleets are affecting American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaiian fisheries; the overall revenue loss to illegal fishing in the Pacific is estimated to be between $4.3 billion to $8.3 billion.REFRegulatory. Complicating matters is that these distant-water fishing fleets are largely unregulated. Nominal responsibility for this resides with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, operating under the guidance of China’s Fisheries Law, now in its fifth version since its 1986 inception. However, these regulations lean more toward advocacy than restrictions. Their provisions include providing financial support, fuel subsidies, and tax exemptions.REFAdditionally, while China’s distant-water fishing fleet is largely off-the-books, it has been estimated to consist of up to 17,000 ships by using location data (e.g., AIS location data) and unique vessel identifier databases (e.g., Krakken’s FishSpektrum). Attempts to regulate this fleet are further hampered by opaque registration and ownership processes.REFStrategic. Likewise, Chinese maritime forces have shown a predilection to protect—not regulate—Chinese fishing fleets. Chinese overseas enforcement is the responsibility of the Chinese Coast Guard (CCG), potentially supported by the paramilitary maritime militia that frequently operates in and amongst fishing fleets. This is worrisome, given the reporting by the China Maritime Studies Institute regarding these forces’ frequent use of intimidation in the South China Sea.REFDrift-Net Fishing. There is, however, one bright spot. Since joining the North Pacific Coast Guard Forum in 2000, the CCG has coordinated enforcement of the United Nation’s ban on drift-net fishing in the North Pacific.REF Sadly, this bright spot may be dimming. Despite past good relations between U.S. and Chinese Coast Guards, alarms were raised in September 2021 when a Chinese naval four-ship flotilla was unexpectedly encountered in Alaskan waters. At the same time a separately deployed CCG flotilla was nearby, indicating China has the capacity to protect its fishing fleets as far afield as Alaska.REFThen, in January 2022, the CCG escorted six Chinese Fisheries Company vessels that were threatened by pirates in the Gulf Aden.REF Such missions should be welcomed, but optimism regarding China being a responsible maritime stakeholder is likely misplaced, given the CCG’s track record of not restraining its fleets from poaching or harmful coral harvesting, especially in the South China Sea.REF It remains an open question whether drift-net ban enforcement by the CCG can be extended more broadly to counter wider concerns of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.Without clear signs that the Chinese Communist Party will restrain its fishing fleets, there is growing potential for confrontation regarding fishing rights in the U.S. EEZ. Since the U.S. has the world’s most extensive maritime claims, it has a large area of vulnerable territory.REF It is likely Chinese fleets have attempted or will soon attempt to poach at scale in U.S. waters, and in that future scenario, U.S. fisheries valued at $5.6 billion could be put at risk.REF According to U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz, “IUU fishing has replaced piracy as the leading global maritime security threat.” The cost of global IUU fishing is estimated to be in the billions of dollars per year.Following the Galapagos crisis amidst international awareness of IUU fishing, the U.S. Coast Guard released a strategic vision to combat IUU fishing. Actualizing that strategy, however, remains a work in progress.U.S. Fisheries. U.S. fisheries are dispersed throughout its Pacific and Atlantic exclusive economic zones, but there are a few areas that stand out as especially important. The two primary ports for American fishing are New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Dutch Harbor, Alaska. New Bedford has the highest value in catch, and Dutch Harbor has the highest catch by volume. By value, the Atlantic catch is responsible for approximately 39 percent and, among the rest, Alaskan waters alone account for 32 percent. The rest of the Pacific (i.e., American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii, etc.) accounts for 12 percent of U.S. seafood by value.REF Given that 20 percent of all catches are from IUU fishing—and that U.S. waters span a vast area consisting of remote U.S. territories—makes it difficult to patrol. All this means that America could lose up to $1 billion worth of lost catches in U.S. waters to IUU fishing.It is the Coast Guard’s and Navy’s responsibility to protect the nation’s maritime rights. But there are serious questions regarding the capacity of U.S. forces to address large-scale Chinese fishing fleets like those seen around the Galapagos Islands. The Navy supports the Coast Guard in its maritime security mission by periodically (on average, twice a year) assigning ships to the Oceania Maritime Security Initiative. This effort embarks Coast Guard personnel on Navy ships to improve maritime security and maritime domain awareness in the Pacific. However, due to operational demands on the Navy, these missions have been infrequent.Coast Guard Response. The Coast Guard is the best tool for enforcing U.S. laws in its EEZs and has the responsibility for protecting marine and other resources, but consistent underinvestment has left it poorly positioned to address growing challenges. In recent years, the Coast Guard has sought to increase its assets based in the Pacific. Today, the Coast Guard’s District 14 patrols the South, Central, and Western Pacific with 10 cutters and maritime patrol aircraft.REF To increase this fleet, in July 2021, the Coast Guard commissioned three new Guam-based Fast Response Cutters.REF These smaller cutters are helpful, but alone are inadequate to cover the vast spaces of U.S. Pacific EEZs. Instead, these three new cutters will likely focus on the nearby EEZs of Guam and the Northern Marinas Islands.Amidst increasing Chinese maritime presence, while still meeting national requirements, adequately patrolling U.S. waters in the Pacific requires a larger fleet. The Coast Guard plans to acquire 11 high-endurance National Security Cutters and 25 medium-endurance Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC).REF Those cutters are planned to equip the Coast Guard for patrols covering all U.S. waters and conduct limited overseas deployments with the Navy.Fleet Numbers. This planned fleet is likely inadequate given the scale of the maritime challenge from Chinese fishing fleets and its military. A 2011 Coast Guard study estimated that its planned acquisitions would only provide 61 percent of the cutters needed to fulfill the Coast Guard’s missions, and a later analysis found it could take up to 57 OPCs to meet mission demands.REF The study identified coverage gaps for various mission sets given the shortfalls of fleet capacity; assessed a high risk for the protection of marine life mission set; and warned of a very high risk for defense readiness, search and rescue, and counter-narcotic mission sets in various areas.This assessment assumes the Coast Guard’s acquisition plan or “Program of Record” is completely funded.REF It also should be noted that China markedly stepped up its aggression and hostile acts in the years following 2011, which is not accounted for in the Coast Guard’s study. However, until the Coast Guard revises its 2004 Program of Record (its last official statement on the required fleet size), it remains uncertain how it will meet contemporary maritime challenges and with what resources.Complicating the Coast Guard’s and the Navy’s efforts to improve presence in this region is the lack of any permanently based ships. The closest bases are in Guam and Hawaii, which include extensive EEZ patrol areas of their own. The problem is amplified as the existing infrastructure (ports, airfields) is antiquated, most dating to World War II or to the nation’s early space program, such as the airfield at Canton Island, Kiribati, which was shuttered in 1976. Needed are more naval forces in the region and their longer-term sustainment in the South and Central Pacific. These include ports, repairs facilities, and airfields. Thankfully, the U.S. is not alone in the region.Stronger collective action is a good first step to better safeguarding U.S. maritime rights in the South and Central Pacific. Allies Australia, France, and New Zealand are capable and resident partners in the Central and South Pacific. France has stationed significant forces (two surveillance Frigates, three patrol vessels, and five maritime patrol aircraft) and has territory (New Caledonia and French Polynesia) in the Pacific. Furthermore, France is a member of the Pacific QUAD (which includes Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.) for coordinating security matters, and, as party to the 1992 FRANZ Agreement, coordinates regional humanitarian assistance with Australia and New Zealand.REFAustralia is an important regional partner. Central to its efforts is the Pacific Maritime Security Program, a $2 billion (Australian dollars), 30-year commitment of in-country staff sustaining a fleet of 21 patrol boats transferred to 12 Pacific island nations, providing regional aerial surveillance, and underwriting efforts to enhance regional coordination.REF However, the September 2021 grounding of Samoa’sREF single Australian-donated patrol boat exposed the limits of the program, leaving the island with no way of patrolling its waters and, therefore, reliant on partner nations.REFLast, New Zealand has limited resources devoted to the region: 131 maritime patrol flying hours and 64 days at sea in fisheries patrols covering its 1.6 million square mile EEZ.REF Given their extensive and dispersed EEZs, individually these allies are hard-pressed to respond to large-scale poaching in their waters. However, better information-sharing and collective action can effectively focus limited naval resources to address the risk of large-scale IUU fishing and protect important sea-lanes.But there is more at play than fish in the great-power competition with China for the Pacific. For decades, a diplomatic contest between Taiwan and China has played out over flipping diplomatic recognition between the two. Militarily, America’s decades-long dominance of the Pacific is fading. Notable are Russian long-range bomber deployments, like that to Indonesia in December 2017, as well as repeated distant Chinese naval deployments. Such deployments by our adversaries make clear the Pacific is being contested and can no longer be considered an American lake.Today the South and Central Pacific includes critical sea and air lanes that support military operations in Asia, long assumed to be beyond any threat. This is no longer a viable military assumption, given Chinese and Russian long-range Pacific deployments, once again making the region of keen strategic importance.Given the paucity of U.S. naval presence and the associated inadequate capacity to patrol its own EEZ, the following actions are offered for consideration.Establish a Southern and Central Pacific Maritime Security Headquarters and Expand Support Infrastructure. To focus resources and enable better regional coordination, the U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area Command and Indo–Pacific Command should establish a detachment in American Samoa. This headquarters’ mission would be to identify and execute needed maritime training and infrastructure projects supporting a sustained maritime security presence, while synchronizing operational (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard’s Operation Blue PacificREF) and capacity-building activities with regional partners.In time, this could include attached units like military construction battalions (e.g., Navy Seabees and Army Corps of Engineers) and home-porting Coast Guard cutters. Additionally, this headquarters would coordinate episodic naval deployments by allies like Japan and the United Kingdom to the region. This will become important, given that the United Kingdom has deployed two patrol ships to the Pacific until 2026. They are expected to periodically operate in this region.REFConduct Annual Pacific QUAD Naval Exercises in the South and Central Pacific. The focus should be to practice wartime logistics, maritime patrol, convoy operations, and interdiction of large fishing fleets (e.g., the 2020 Galapagos Islands incident). The first iteration of this exercise should be coordinated to occur in conjunction with the establishment of the headquarters in American Samoa overseeing these exercises. Additionally, given Japan’s growing and welcome diplomatic footprint in the region, there may be value in announcing the launch of this exercise from one of its regional embassies. This could also be beneficial in highlighting the economic and policing aspects of these exercises throughout the region. Allowance should be made for future participation of Pacific island nation navies, notably from Fiji and Tonga.Standardize Maritime Policing Practices with Pacific Island Nations and Pacific QUAD Members. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been good use of virtual policing to enable a land-based third party to authorize maritime policing in its waters. This should be expanded and standardized so that, at a minimum, Pacific-QUAD members can support policing in all the participating nations’ EEZ.Create a Regionally Focused Maritime-Security-Capacity-Building Funding Account. For South and Central Pacific Island Nations, Congress should establish a security cooperation account like the Maritime Security Initiative of 2015.REF Likewise, to enable greater regional economic maritime development with military utility, the U.S. Secretary of Defense should identify ports and airfields to the Development Finance CorporationREF for favorable solicitation of investment proposals.The U.S. Coast Guard Should Increase Transparency on Its Fleet Needs by Updating Its Program of Record and Releasing a Report About the Degree of Risk It Is Accepting with Various Fleet Mixes. The lack of clear information on the Coast Guard’s fleet requirements makes it difficult for Congress to conduct effective oversight and for the public debate on new cutter acquisitions to be well-informed. Studies more than a decade old are still driving the debate—studies that do not take into account shifting mission demands and a dramatically changing global operating environment. In order to assist the Coast Guard to meet its missions, more information is required to inform the debate on the fleet.Develop Techniques for Countering Large-Scale IUU Fishing. Given the size of Chinese distant-waters fishing fleets, the U.S. Coast Guard’s training and techniques need to be developed and practiced to protect U.S. waters. These techniques must include countermeasures for dealing with Chinese maritime militia interspersed amidst large fishing fleets.Assess the Potential Value of Fishing and Implications of IUU Fishing in U.S. Waters. Congress should direct the U.S. Coast Guard, in concert with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, to provide a report on the impact of illegal fishing on the U.S. fishing industry, impacts to local communities (e.g., American Samoa), and an update on the U.S. Coast Guard’s IUU Fishing Implementation Plan.Because of other operational requirements, today’s U.S. Navy is largely absent from the South and Central Pacific. Fortunately, the Coast Guard has not had to deal with large illegal Chinese fishing fleets in U.S. waters—yet. Nevertheless, the day when it will is fast approaching, and today it has limited ability to interdict such illicit maritime activity in U.S. Pacific EEZs. To fund the U.S. Coast Guard for this mission will take a different mindset, one that Congress, the Biden Administration, and the military need to realize and implement.Action is required to safeguard economic and security interests in this strategic region. Mobilizing the Pacific QUAD for maritime security is an important step until more Coast Guard cutters arrive. A visible and sustained maritime security presence in this region can deter IUU fishing while better securing critical sea and air lanes in the event of conflict in Asia.Moreover, the Coast Guard will be an important player in the nation’s strategic approach to China. The Coast Guard is, in fact, the best trained to take on peacetime competition in this region while building coalitions of like-minded nations. For too long, multiple Administrations have underappreciated and under-resourced the Coast Guard for its unavoidable role in great-power competition with China. This must change.Brent D.

            "text The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust.It’s always chancy to unleash the dogs of war: You never know who they’re going to bite. With Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine, all we know for sure is that, regardless of the outcome, the result won’t exactly be rosy for the Russian president. It does seem clear what Mr. Putin thought would happen. For some reason, his Kremlin crowd decided now was the time to swallow Ukraine whole, once and for all. Why?Perhaps it’s because they saw weakness in President Biden, as well as in a tentative cluster of European countries on the other side of Ukraine. He obviously gambled that they’d be unwilling to do much for Ukraine.>>> Germany Has Woken UpAs Mr. Putin massed his military, he thought that either the West would flinch and hand over the country, or Russian forces would invade in a lightning campaign, assassinate all the key government officials on day one or two, and frighten the Ukrainians into capitulation with their show of strength. After the West wouldn’t cut a deal, Mr. Putin rolled the dice on a quick win.Well, here we are in the second week of the two-day invasion, and the Ukrainian flag is still flying.There are still several possible outcomes. If Mr. Putin really wants to win—and since he has risked so much already—it’s too much to expect that he will easily back down. The most likely outcome, sadly, is that the Russian will direct his troops to fight until he grounds Ukraine into dust, leaving a devastated country and masses of butchered innocents and refugees in his wake. That, now, is the “best” Mr. Putin can hope for.Here is why the most optimistic outcome for Mr. Putin is still bad news for him. For one, the cost will be astronomical. Mr. Biden, arguably, helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war with reckless energy policies that have oil prices rocketing to as much as $130 a barrel. While oil exports can help pay for the Putin war, the cost isn’t cheap. The protracted conflict is burning through Russian cash.The cost of occupying any wasteland Mr. Putin conquered would be higher. At the same time, the value of the Russian currency is crashing, blazing faster than a Russian helicopter shot down by a stinger missile. And sanctions are going to make doing business worldwide much more difficult.After Ukraine, Mr. Putin might want to move on to other targets including lands where Russia is already a threatening influence—in the Balkans, Moldova, and Georgia, or even NATO territory like the Baltic states. At best, though, the Russian military would have to pause and regroup.NATO, for one, would likely be a much more difficult target. Mr. Putin has inadvertently finished President Trump’s work for him. The allies’ rush to beef up defense capabilities—led by, of all countries, Germany—is surely not a scenario Mr. Putin had hoped for. If the momentum continues, Mr. Putin will face a military stalemate.Further, if this crisis propels America and Europe to face the need to come up with responsible policies that deliver affordable, reliable, and abundant energy without relying on Russia, Mr. Putin will lose his two main weapons to intimidate the West: military and energy blackmail. >>> What China Is Learning From Putin’s Ukraine InvasionWorse, Mr. Putin’s only remaining friend of consequence is China. That’s like saying the only person who has Jason Voorhees’s back is Freddy Krueger. Beijing can’t be happy it’s had to shill for Mr. Putin’s inexcusable war of aggression. That only makes China look like an accomplice. It can’t bail out the enormous backsliding of the Russian economy.As for President Xi’s claim that he was misled by Mr. Putin: nonsense. Sure, China hopes to avoid blow-back from the anger that the free world is heaping on Moscow, but it’s all in for Russia and will do what it can to help. While this all seems bad for Mr. Putin, it could be an even worse winter in Moscow if Ukrainians continue their heroic stand and his forces can’t conquer the country.None of Mr. Putin’s misery should give us joy. His tragedy was born of greater tragedy. Forty-four million Ukrainians were thrown to the wolves because Mr. Biden couldn’t muster a response to Mr. Putin’s threat.The greatest leaders prevent the wars of tyrants by peace through strength. Mr. Biden looks like the fireman who took a day off and let the arsonist run wild.This piece originally appeared in The Sun \n",

            "text Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped to unify Europe against Russia, it has had a divisive effect in the Middle East, where many countries recently have hedged their bets by boosting ties to Moscow to offset declining confidence in U.S. leadership.Even before the Biden administration’s Afghanistan withdrawal debacle last August, U.S. allies and partners in the Middle East were dismayed by a downsizing of the U.S. military presence in the region, incessant talk of an American “pivot” to Asia, and the administration’s commitment to restoring the flawed 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.  They rightfully fear that another weak nuclear deal will allow Tehran to pocket billions of dollars and escalate its military and terrorist threats against its neighbors.These reservations about U.S. policy also have hampered cooperation with regional allies and partners on mitigating the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting U.S. sanctions on Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.While announcing the ban on Russian oil imports to the U.S. on Tuesday, President Joe Biden acknowledged that oil prices could surge higher and sought to pin the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin:This decision today is not without costs here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the pump—and this will drive up costs further. So, I will take every step we can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home.But Biden’s efforts to lobby for increased oil production from Middle Eastern oil exporters have failed to produce adequate alternatives to the Russian oil.  Washington initially was rebuffed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the only oil exporters that have significant untapped oil production capacity.The two countries announced that they were sticking to an oil production agreement struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC oil producers led by Russia.The United Arab Emirates later moderated its initial position in a statement released on Wednesday by Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba: “We favor production increases and will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher production levels.”Gulf Arabs Snub BidenTo make matters worse, The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the United Arab Emirates’ Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan both recently declined U.S. requests to speak to Biden by phone. Both, however, took phone calls the previous week from Putin.This snub of Biden stands in stark contrast to Saudi behavior in 2018, when it ramped up oil exports to stabilize oil prices after then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran.The Saudis and Emiratis feel neglected by the Biden administration, which they assess has failed to adequately respond to mounting threats to their security posed by Iran and its proxy militias.   Both governments were stung by Biden’s criticism of their military intervention in Yemen, the freezing of some U.S. arms sales to their armed forces, and the withdrawal last year of U.S. military forces and missile defenses from their countries at a time when they face rising threats from Iranian drones and missiles, including many launched by Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen.The Biden administration also burned its bridges to the crown prince, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Biden promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to treat the crown prince as a pariah for his role in the 2018 death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The Biden administration’s cold shoulder encouraged the Saudis and Emiratis to hedge their bets on U.S. security guarantees by trying to improve their relations with Russia, China, and even Iran.Time to recalibrate U.S. Mideast policyAlthough the Biden administration has been quick to blame Putin for spiking global energy prices, its own flawed energy policies also have contributed to the current energy predicament. The administration has undermined U.S. energy security in its rush to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources that will not be scaling up fast enough to support that transition anytime soon. That trade-off has now become more visible.The Biden administration’s reported overtures to Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro for increased oil supplies have rightfully raised eyebrows. This objectionable option could have been avoided if the administration had maintained better relations with major Arab oil kingdoms.The Biden administration needs to recalibrate its Middle East policy to give a higher priority to energy security and the need to deter and defend against a broad spectrum of Iranian threats to regional security.   Perhaps then it could depend on the full cooperation of long-term partners in the Middle East who have harbored increasing doubts about U.S. security guarantees. Maybe then they would even agree to accept a phone call from the White House.This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal\n",

            "text Since 2002, the United States Air Force has been on a fitful path to recapitalization of its fleet of air refueling aircraft, which now average 55 years old.REF In an effort to save money, it has reduced its fleet size by retiring aging tankers without suitable replacements. It also has based its future tanker capacity requirements on regional rather than peer-level threats. As it continues to wrestle with a replacement tanker that has experienced considerable delays, the service should:The Air Force began a process to replace its fleet of KC-135 and KC-10 tankers in 2001 with a controversial sole-source proposal that involved both buying and leasing new aircraft from the Boeing Corporation. That program was terminated in 2005 after corruption related to Boeing’s lease proposal was uncovered.REFFollowing that inauspicious start, in 2006, the Air Force issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a highly capable, medium-sized, low-risk, and low-cost tanker to replace the oldest KC-135s in the inventory.REF The two vendors that submitted proposals were the Boeing Corporation and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the parent of Airbus at the time, in partnership with Northrup-Grumman. EADS won the contract, but shortly after the award, Boeing filed a formal protest.REF Many in Congress voiced their concerns to the Office of the Secretary of Defense about the award of a major weapons system to a foreign company,REF and in 2008, Secretary Robert Gates terminated the program.REF After a cooling-off period, the Air Force revised the requirements and requested a new set of proposals for its next tanker.The cost of Boeing’s submission in that round of competition reportedly was less than the cost of the EADS submission, and in 2011, the Air Force awarded Boeing a contract to modify its already successful 767 airliner into the KC-46A air refueling platform and deliver a total of 179 tankers in a program that would become known as KC-X.REF The first seven jets were to be delivered in 2015; 18 were to achieve initial operational capability (IOC) by August 2017;REF and the last six were to be acquired in 2027.REFOver the years, the initiative to replace the tanker fleet has morphed into three incremental acquisition programs known as KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z. KC-X acquisition will be completed with the last KC-46A delivery; KC-Y, also known as the Bridge Tanker, was initially intended to replace the KC-10s and a tranche of older KC-135s beginning in 2029; and the KC-Z will replace the remaining KC-135s at some point in the future.REFThe KC-X program has suffered several technical and production challenges, and the Air Force is now on track to accept the last of the KC-46s in 2029 after a three-year delay. To continue the seamless replacement of its aging tankers, the service intends to solicit proposals for KC-Y by the end of 2022 with the intent of receiving the first of as many as 160 tankers in 2029.REFThe KC-46 was designed to refuel both Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps aircraft, and the difference between these two systems are significant.Air Force tanker booms can be configured to fly with a drogue/basket (only) to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, or they can fly with two additional drogue/basket pods mounted on the wings, allowing the tanker to refuel either type of aircraft on the same mission. C-130s can be configured with drogue/basket systems to refuel probe-equipped aircraft, but their offload capacity is much lower because the airframe is smaller and therefore carries less fuel.For the purposes of this paper, C-130s are referred to as tactical air refueling systems, and KC-135, KC-10, KC-46, and KC-Y systems are referred to as strategic air refueling systems/tankers. Before the service begins the selection process for the KC-Y, it is important that the status of the KC-X program and the challenges that have characterized deliveries of the KC-46A be understood.To date, more than 60 KC-46s have been delivered, but even at the most basic level, the program has been marred by a string of system design problems and production faults. The KC-46 design incorporated the concept for a Remote Vision System (RVS) that molds video from multiple cameras at the rear of the plane to create a two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) vision system, allowing the boom operator to sit in the main cabin and refuel the aircraft remotely.During flight testing in 2016 and 2017, aircrew identified several major issues with the RVS and the aircraft’s refueling boom that inhibit the KC-46A from executing its primary mission: refueling other aircraft.REF The jet’s boom was too stiff, which proved to be problematic for fueling lighter aircraft like A-10s and F-16s.REF Problems surrounding the RVS were first reported as issues surrounding a “sunlight glare” during certain times of the day, but the challenge is much deeper.The RVS 2D/3D, black-and-white cameras are mounted at the rear of the KC-46, just behind the aircraft’s boom. While the camera image can wash out during certain sun angles, even when paired with the jet’s 3D goggles, the system does not give boomers the depth perception they need to conduct normal air refueling operations. Stunningly, the system often fails to capture or display the length of the telescopic boom as it extends to make contact with receiver aircraft.REFThe alignment of the RVS cameras in relation to the air refueling boom’s outer tubeREF effectively obscures or masks the last several feet of the telescoping portion of the boom,REF including the refueling probe that makes contact with the refueling receptacles of receiver aircraft.REF If the lighting/sun angle is right, the system can pick up the end of the boom’s shadow on top of the receiving aircraft. This work-around gives boomers the opportunity to gauge the position of the tip of the boom before attempting to connect to receiving aircraft. However, it also assumes the best of conditions, and when viewed in context with current refueling procedures, its associated challenges become glaringly obvious.The refueling receptacle for the F-16 is located several feet behind the cockpit and is not visible to pilots flying those single-seat fighters. Refueling procedures for the F-16 call for the pilots to fly to a position directly in line with the end of the tanker’s boom and then move forward directly toward the end of the probe. As the distance between the end of the boom and the jet’s canopy closes, the boomer uses his depth perception to judge when to move the boom around and then directly behind the F-16’s canopy to make contact with the jet’s refueling receptacle. With questionable depth perception, no reliable ability to see the end of the boom, and no usable surface area in front of the canopy to catch the boom’s shadow, attempting to refuel an F-16 with the KC-46’s RVS system during daytime in clear weather conditions is challenging.In addition, during heavy weather or clear-air turbulence, the tanker and receiver aircraft can move up and down rapidly without warning, often in opposing cycles. Attempting to make a refueling connection without relevant depth perception and without being able to see the end of the boom under those conditions elevates what would otherwise be a benign procedure to one that is mishap-prone, even with the most experienced boomers.While the technical challenges with the boom and RVS are troubling, issues with basic workmanship are equally illuminating. In February 2019, an internal Boeing management memo noted that Air Force pilots were finding so much debris and so many loose tools throughout brand-new jets that “they will not fly [them] due to the FOD (foreign object debris) issues and the current [lack of] confidence they have in our product….”REFBoeing was able to win the KC-X contract primarily because it met three criteria: cost, preservation of the U.S. industrial base for tankers, and previous experience in building the KC-135. While noble in design, all three criteria have delivered poor outcomes for the KC-X acquisition program.Boeing reportedly underbid EADS in a firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract that made it financially responsible for cost overruns. To date, the company has absorbed some $5.4 billion in cost overrunsREF that otherwise would have been borne by the government through a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.FFP contracts work well for proven systems or for those with very high technology readiness levels (TRLs), but the design for the KC-46’s RVS system met neither of those criteria. On the surface, Boeing’s FFP contract for the KC-X effectively limited a great deal of financial risk to the government, but it also has caused a significant amount of operational risk. Forcing or even allowing a contractor to insert a low-TRL system under such an agreement can put contractors in dire financial straits, and the collateral effects within this effort have exposed the government to operational risks with enormous attendant costs.Eleven years after the KC-X contract was awarded, the Air Force is accepting aircraft that are years away from having a viable operational capability, and the program remains anything but low risk. The new tanker is prohibited from supporting real-world contingency operations, and the jet’s initial operating capability (IOC) date has slipped to fiscal year (FY) 2024 at the earliest.REF By that time, the Air Force will have taken possession of some 103 KC-46s.REFThe Air Force estimates that the fix for the boom and RVS should be ready by the spring of 2024,REF but the shortcuts the service is taking to make that timeline are eye-opening. The problems with the current system were discovered during flight testing, yet the Air Force has decided not to assess or flight test the fully revised RVS before it accepts the design.REF Problems discovered beyond that point could result in even more significant delays, and the costs for fixing the system will be borne by the Air Force.Assuming the redesign goes as planned, retrofitting jets that the service has already accepted with the boom and RVS redesign will take several years, and the operational impact of that process will be significant: 103 strategic air refueling assets will be unusable in real-world operations in 2024. That number will grow to 110 jets in 2025, equating to 23 percent of the fleet that will be unable to fulfill operational taskings. Assuming that the design and retrofit stay on track, the numbers will slowly start to improve through 2029 when all KC-46s will be fully operational.REFRecognizing the gap in operational capability, Congress, through the FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), directed the Air Force to slow or curtail the retirement of viable tanker aircraft until the KC-46 comes up to speed.REF Unfortunately, that move has introduced still other challenges. As the service continues to accept new KC-46s, the squadrons and crews that transition to those jets are no longer available to fly the operationally capable KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. The Air Force is studying methods for filling those cockpits and covering the operational gapsREF by hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is retiring. However, while this option may buy down operational risk, it will undoubtedly impose a significant financial burden on the Air Force.Because crews that transition to the KC-46 need to continue training, the service moved last year to meet that need as well as to relieve KC-10 and KC-135 operational tempo where possible. The Air Force approved the KC-46A for stateside operations and refueling missions in support of U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM); for aircraft that employ probe/drogue refueling (Navy/Marine Corps fighters); and for 11 Air Force platforms.REF The list does not include the F-35, F-22, or B-2 because of the likelihood of the KC-46 RVS/boom system’s errantly damaging the stealth coatings on those jets. Commanders may elect to waive that restriction during contingency or wartime operations, but they will have to accept the increased operational risk.Boeing is at least seven years away from delivering 179 fully operational KC-46s, and risks to the service and its wartime mission between now and 2029 will be significant. It is important to keep those lessons in mind as the Air Force moves to acquire the next increment of tankers, particularly in light of recent events and the possibility that they might escalate into great-power conflict. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced even the most dovish nations within NATO to revise their defense spending to ready their nations for a possible conflict with Russia,REF and the Commander of Indo-Pacific Command has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that China could move on Taiwan by 2027.REF The potential for great-power conflict is growing, and the United States needs to acquire the capacity to fight such a war.Later this year, the Air Force will release an RFP for the next increment of 150 strategic tankers. Both the Boeing Corporation and Lockheed Martin/Airbus are expected to submit proposals that are designed to capture the KC-Y contract. Boeing is expected to offer the KC-46A that is currently in production in the United States. The Airbus/Lockheed Martin KC-Y proposal, named the Lockheed Martin Next Generation Tanker or LMXT, will be a modified version of Airbus’s A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT).The MRTT is already operational and has been certified to refuel every fighter aircraft in the U.S. Air Force and Navy inventories. It has a boom enhanced vision system (BEVS) with 3D, high-definition color displays that allow boomers to sit in the main cabin and remotely refuel other aircraft. BEVS was designed to enable automated air refueling (refueling without a boom operator) using machine vision algorithms. That sub-system is on track to be certified for automatic daytime refueling later in 2022 and nighttime refueling in 2023. Based on the Airbus A-330 airliner, the MRTT design will be modified to increase its fuel capacity.Both the KC-46 and the LMXT have cargoREF and passenger carriage capabilities and are designed to accept high-end command and control equipment to further the Air Battle Management System/Joint Air Domain Command and Control network efforts. However, those capabilities are secondary to the air refueling mission, and the RFP and follow-on acquisition decision process must prioritize those capabilities accordingly.While the overarching tanker acquisition strategy has morphed over the years, the KC-Y Bridge Tanker program was initially designed to replace the KC-10, a jet that can carry significantly more fuel than the KC-135 carries. The distances and fuel offload capacity required to establish a tanker bridge and sustain operations from the United States to the area of operations would be much greater in a peer fight with China than they would be in a fight with Russia. That fact, coupled with China’s intent to target any tanker base within range of its air-to-surface missile systems, makes fuel offload capacity at range a critical capability. The KC-10 carries a maximum of 356,000 pounds of fuel, which is 70 percent more than either the KC-135 or KC-46 can carry, but it burns fuel at a much higher rate than the KC-135, KC46, or LMXT. The KC-135 has a capacity of 200,000 pounds, and the KC-46 can carry 211,000 pounds,REF but the LMXT can carry 268,445 pounds.REFThe operational effects of that additional capacity are not insignificant. In real terms, the LMXT could refuel seven more F-35s than the KC-46 can refuel when the offload point (Air Refueling Contact Point or ARCP) is 1,000 miles from the tanker’s launch and recovery base, six more at an operating radius of 2,000 miles, and five more at 3,000 miles. The LMXT and KC-10 can offload the same amount of fuel at 2,500 miles, but from that point on, because of its more efficient engines, the LMXT can offload more than even the KC-10 is able to offload.REFThe LMXT’s increased capacity and proven track record make it a viable contender in this competition. Because the KC-46 is smaller than the LMXT, it conceivably could operate out of more bases in the Pacific region when both aircraft are loaded to their maximum gross weights. When both aircraft are loaded to the same gross weights, however, the LMXT can fly out of more airfields because of its more powerful engines. Assuming that the issues with its boom and RVS are resolved in due course, the KC-46 will be a serious contender, but it will take years for those issues to be resolved, and acquiring an additional 150 Pegasus platforms before the fix has been accepted would therefore be unwise. Delaying the KC-Y acquisition decision until the KC-46 becomes operational is an option, but such a delay would levy even more risk on an already strained tanker fleet.Pressure from Members of Congress and industrial partners to embrace that risk and fall back on the same cost savings and buy-American criteria that got the service in trouble with the KC-X program will undoubtedly be high. Both sticker price and preservation of an organic American industrial base for tankers are important considerations, but as previously noted, the costs associated with filling the operational gaps created by the KC-46 RVS and boom issues are likewise important. Perhaps as a sign that Airbus/Lockheed Martin learned from their previous proposal, they now have plans to assemble the A-330 airframe in Mobile, Alabama, and modify it into the LMXT tanker in Marietta, Georgia.Finally, the critical technology within the LMXT proposal is already operational and at work in dozens of fielded MRTT platforms, which means the risk associated with acquiring this system would be minimal. The Bridge Tanker acquisition decision is a critical one, and it will be important for the service to go through the acquisition process by the book and avoid the gaffes and resets that it suffered with the KC-X in the mid-2000s. The service needs as many operational booms as it can field for a possible fight with China—even more capacity than it currently is programmed to acquire.By the end of the KC-X, KC-Y, and KC-Z acquisition programs, the Air Force will have replaced all KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft with new and more capable tankers while reducing the total number of strategic refueling platforms from 479 to 457. That number is woefully insufficient for a peer fight, based on the recent history of real-world operations as well as formal tanker requirement studies.In both 1991 and 2003, the Air Force possessed some 600 KC-135 and KC-10 tankers.REF When the service executed Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, it employed some 271 tankers to support the airbridge to the Persian Gulf as well as combat operations in Iraq.REF Twelve years later, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the demand for Air Force tankers peaked at 319 and then leveled off to a continual demand of 280 (95 airbridge and 185 combat support)—a number that did not include tankers from sister services or allies.REFWith today’s inventory of 479 aircraft, that daily tanker support requirement for a regional war against a Third World adversary would consume 58 percent of our current fleet, and that number does not include combat losses, tankers required to defend the homeland or support deterrence operations in a second theater, or tankers held in reserve to support nuclear strike operations. According to a recent Hudson Institute study, this could mean an additional 325 tankers,REF which, when combined with the sustained Operation Iraqi Freedom requirement of 280 tankers, equates to a capacity requirement of 605 strategic air refueling aircraft.While those numbers are significant, the airbridge and combat support requirements for a peer fight, particularly one conducted in the threat environment and over the vast distances associated with a fight with China, would likely dwarf that number. A U.S. Department of Defense Study completed in 2001 concluded that “500–600 KC-135R equivalents” were needed “to meet the National Military Strategy,” and a 2005 Mobility Capabilities Study “reportedly recommended the acquisition of 520–640 KC-135R model equivalents.”REF Both of those studies were conducted long before the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) directed the services to prepare for great-power competition with China or Russia.REFSeven months after the 2018 NDS was released, the Secretary of the Air Force released “The Air Force We Need,” a study examining the capacity the service would need to support that strategy. Based on thousands of war-game simulations, the study found that the service would need 14 more tanker squadrons than the 40 it had at the time,REF which equates to a total of 691 strategic refueling platforms.REFAlthough the service has backed away from the study because of the associated cost, it remains the most accurate estimate we have for the tanker requirements associated with great-power competition. Other alliances with other nations may bring additional fighter capacity to such a fight, but almost every nation will need the strategic tanker support that only the Air Force can bring.The Air Force should increase its capacity requirement to match the approximately 691 tankers recommended in “The Air Force We Need,” and now is an excellent time to begin. As previously noted, the Air Force is studying methods for covering the operational gaps caused by delays associated with the KC-46. One option would be to shift “retiring” active-duty air refueling assets to the Reserve Component. This would undoubtedly be less expensive than a commercial option, and the assets and crews would have no geographic constraint on where they could fly in times of war.Hiring private organizations/aircrews to maintain, operate, and fly the tankers the service is moving to retire might also be a viable option. While constraints on where those leased platforms could fly would be an issue, the option would allow the service to build the 691-tanker capacity requirement for a peer fight, satisfy congressional concerns, and allow the service to continue or even accelerate its programmed retirements of the KC-10 and KC-135 tanker fleets.REFCongress should:For its part, the Air Force should:The Air Force should move immediately to strengthen the path to recapitalization of its fleet of strategic air refueling aircraft through seamless competition, both to incentivize performance within and to expand the tanker industrial base. The Defense Department should maintain the current proposal and acquisition schedule for the KC-Y, and the award should prioritize proven performance and the minimization of risk. The retirement of viable tanker aircraft fleet should end until operational replacements are in place, and the Air Force should increase its air refueling capacity from 479 to 691 owned or leased tankers to ensure that it is better prepared for possible conflict with a peer competitor.John Venable is Senior Research Fellow for Defense Policy in the Center for National Defense, of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, at The Heritage Foundation.\n",
